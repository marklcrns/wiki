x 1. The market supply curve is

   - a graphical representation of the individual supply schedule.

2. A change in price causes movement along a demand curve and a change in
   <kbd>the quantity demanded</kbd>.

3. Your savings account pays 8 percent per year: Each $100 in the bank grows to
   $108 over a one-year period. If prices increase by 8 percent per year, by

4. Demand is
   - elastic
   along the upper portion of a downward sloping linear demand curve,
   - inelastic
   along the lower portion of a downward sloping linear demand curve, and
   - unit elastic
   elastic at the midpoint of a downward sloping linear demand curve.  Demand is
   - perfectly inelastic
   for a vertical linear demand curve and
