1. A key feature of a monopoly is that

  - <kbd>marginal revenue is less than price.</kbd>

2. The short-run marginal cost (MC) is

  - $\frac{\Delta \text{Total cost}}{\Delta \text{Output}}$

3. A firm will continue to operate an unprofitable business if <kbd>total
   revenue</kbd> exceeds <kbd>variable cost</kbd>. The shut-down price, which
   equals minimum <kbd>average variable cost</kbd>, is the price at which the
   firm is <kbd>indifferent between operating and shutting down</kbd>.

4. Consumer surplus equals

  - <kbd>the amount a consumer is willing to pay minus the amount the consumer
    actually pays.</kbd>

5. Rent seeking is

  - <kbd>the process of using public policy to gain economic profit.</kbd>

6. In an increasing-cost industry, the long-run supply curve is

  - <kbd>positively sloped because the greater demand for inputs and labor
    increases the average cost of producing the product.</kbd>

7. A perfectly competitive industry has 75 identical firms. At a price of $5,
   the typical firm supplies 7 units of output, so the market quantity supplied
   is <kbd>525</kbd> units of output. (Enter your response as an integer.)

8. In general, a policy that limits entry into a market

  - <kbd>increases price, decreases quantity, and causes inefficiency in the
    market.</kbd>

9. The marginal cost of an item is shown below. If the price of the item is $12,
   how much should the firm produce?

| Output per hour | Marginal Cost |
|-----------------|---------------|
| 400             | $12           |
| 500             | $14           |

10. The U.S. restricts imported sugar such that only domestic producers are
    allowed to supply sugar to the market. This is shown in the diagram to the
    right. The import ban will <kbd>increase</kbd> the price of sugar, will
    <kbd>decrease</kbd> the total market quantity of sugar, and will
    <kbd>increase</kbd> the quantity of sugar produced by domestic firms.

11. At a price of $15 per CD, the marginal revenue of a CD seller is $9. If the
    marginal cost of CDs is $7, the firm should <kbd>lower</kbd> its price to
    <kbd>increase</kbd> the quantity sold.  

12. When the government sets a <kbd>minimum</kbd> price that exceeds the
    equilibrium price, the result is permanent excess <kbd>supply</kbd>.
    Producers will produce <kbd>more</kbd> and consumers buy <kbd>less</kbd>.

<!--- ? --->
13. Refer to the figure on the right.  Suppose the output of a large
    aluminum firm drops from 1 million pounds to 0.5 million pounds per
    year.  The long-run average cost of producing aluminum will go
    from $<kbd>2.8</kbd> to $<kbd>1.6</kbd>. (Enter your responses
    rounded to the nearest penny.)

14. At the current level of output, the marginal cost of chairs
    exceeds the average cost. If you increase output, the average cost
    will <kbd>increase</kbd>.

15. A switch from perfect competition to monopoly <kbd>increases</kbd> the price
    and <kbd>decreases</kbd> the quantity sold. Consumer surplus
    <kbd>decreases</kbd>, while profit <kbd>increases</kbd>. The net loss to
    society is the <kbd>deadweight</kbd> loss from monopoly.

16. The graph shown at right shows production in both a monopoly market and a
    perfectly competitive market.  Which of the shaded regions shows the
    increased producer  surplus from the existence of a monopoly?

      - <kbd>b</kbd>

    Area A represents

      - <kbd>additional windfall profits to the monopolist.</kbd>

17. Payoff for Casino Approval. In 1993, seven Native American Tribes in
    Michigan cut a deal with the state. In exchange for being granted a monopoly
    in Vegas-style casino gambling, the tribes agreed to pay the state and local
    governments a share of its profits. By 1998, the profit sharing totaled more
    than $183 million. Why did the tribes propose this deal?

    - <kbd>All of the above.</kbd>

18. **Tax Cuts for Discounters?** Consider the following statement from a member of
    a city council:

    "Several of the merchants in our city offer discounts to
    our senior citizens. These discounts obviously decrease the merchants'
    profits, so we should decrease the merchants' taxes to offset their losses
    on senior-citizen discounts."

    Do you agree or disagree? <kbd>Disagree</kbd>

19. An increase in the price of shirts will cause firms to <kbd>enter</kbd> the
    industry.  Entry will continue until <kbd>average cost</kbd> equals
    <kbd>marginal cost</kbd>.

20. Your firm has a total revenue of $600, a total cost of $1 comma 000, and a
    variable cost of $100.  You should <kbd>operate</kbd> because <kbd>total
    revenue</kbd> exceeds <kbd>variable cost</kbd>.

21. All of the following are true about rent control EXCEPT:

    - <kbd>it provides ample housing for low income residents.</kbd>

22. A marginal cost curve intersects the average cost curve at the
    <kbd>minimum</kbd> point of the average cost curve.

23. An information good has a <kbd>large</kbd> first-copy cost, and a
    <kbd>small</kbd> marginal cost.

24. In the figure shown to the right, the sixth lawn is not cut because the

    an average cost of $3 per dose and a price of $6 per dose. You sell 1 comma
    000 doses per day. If a generic version of the drug were introduced, your

    each day to prevent the entry of the generic version? $<kbd>6</kbd> per day. (Enter
    your response rounded to the nearest dollar.)

30. For a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue equals <kbd>marginal
    cost</kbd>, and to maximize profit, the firm produces the quantity of output

35. Same Average Cost with Different Quantities? Suppose there are two pencil
    producers with identical production facilities--identical factories and
    equipment. The firms pay the same wages and pay the same prices for
    materials. Sam has a small workforce and produces 200 pencils per minute;
    Marian has a medium-size workforce and produces 400 pencils per minute. The
    two firms have the same average total cost of 10 cents per pencil. Suppose
    you build a production facility identical to the ones used by the other
    firms and hire enough workers and buy enough materials to produce 600
