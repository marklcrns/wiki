5. Should a Heart Surgeon Do Her Own Plumbing? A heart surgeon is skillful at
   unplugging arteries and rerouting the flow of blood, and these skills also
   make her a very skillful plumber. She can clear a clogged drain in 6 minutes,
   about 10 times faster than the most skillful plumber in town. Suppose the
