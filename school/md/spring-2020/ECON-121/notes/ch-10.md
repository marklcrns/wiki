# Chapter 10: Monolopoly and Price Discrimination

<a name="monopoly">**Monopoly**</a>

  - A market in which a single firm sells a product that does not have any close
    substitutes.
  -  In contrast with a perfectly competitive, or price-taking, firm, a
     monopolist controls the price of its product, so we can refer to a
     monopolist as a _price maker_.
  - A monopolist has market power, the ability to affect the price of its
    product.

<a name="market-power">**Market power**</a>

  - The ability of a firm to affect the price of its product.

<a name="barrier-to-entry">**Barrier to entry**</a>

  - Something that prevents firms entering a profitable market.

A monopoly occurs when a barrier to entry prevents a second firm from entering
a profitable market. Among the possible barriers to entry are patents, network
externalities, government licensing, the ownership or control of a key
resource, and large economies of scale in production:

  - A **patent** grants an inventor the exclusive right to sell a new product
    for some period of time, currently 20 years under international rules.
  - When the value of a product to a consumer increases with the number of
    consumers who use it, **network externalities** are at work. For example,
    the larger the number of people on an online social network, the greater the
    opportunities for interaction. Similarly, the larger the number of people
    using a software application such as a word processor, the greater the
    opportunities to share files. Network externalities provide an advantage to
    existing firms and may inhibit the entry of new ones.
  - Under a licensing policy, the government chooses a single firm to sell a
    particular product. Some examples are licensing for radio and television
    stations, off-street parking in cities, and vendors in national parks.
  - If a firm owns or controls a key resource, the firm can prevent entry by
    refusing to sell the input to other firms. The classic example is DeBeers,
    the South African company that controls about 80 percent of the world’s
    production of diamonds. Before the 1940s, the Aluminum Company of
    AmericaALCOAhad long-term contracts to buy most of the world’s available
    bauxite, a key input to the production of aluminum.
  - A **natural monopoly** occurs when the scale economies in production are so
    large that only a single large firm can earn a profit. The market can
    support only one profitable firm because if a second firm entered the
    market, both firms would lose money. Some examples are cable TV service,
    electricity transmission, and water systems.


## 10.1 The Monopolist's Output Decision

### 10.1.1 Total Revenue and Marginal Revenue

![Figure 10.1 The Demand Curve and the Marginal-Revenue Curve](file:../../../../files/spring-2020/ECON-121/ch-10/ch-10_figure-10.1.png)

> Marginal revenue equals the price for the first unit sold, but is less than
the price for additional units sold. To sell an additional unit, the firm cuts
the price and receives less revenue on the units that could have been sold at
the higher price. The marginal revenue is positive for the first four units, and
negative for larger quantities.

The trade-offs faced by a monopolist in cutting the price to sell a larger
quantity. When the firm cuts its price from $12 to $10, there is good news and
bad news:

  - **Good news**: The firm collects $10 from the new customer (the third), so
    revenue increases by $10.
  - **Bad news**: The firm cuts the price for all its customers, so it gets less
    revenue from the customers who would have been willing to pay the higher
    price of $12. Specifically, the firm collects $2 less from each of the two
    original customers, so revenue from the original customers decreases by $4.

Our discussion of good news and bad news has revealed a key feature of a
monopoly: Marginal revenue is less than price. To sell one more unit, the
monopolist must cut its price, and the difference between marginal revenue and
price is the bad news--the loss in revenue from consumers who would have bought
the good at the higher price. In fact, this is true for any firm that must cut
its price to sell more.

If a perfectly competitive firm sells one unit at $12, it can sell a second unit
at the same price, so its marginal revenue is $12 for the second unit sold, just
as it was $12 for the first unit sold. For a perfectly competitive firm,
marginal revenue is always equal to the price, no matter how many units the firm
sells. A perfectly competitive firm does not cut the price to sell more, so
there is no bad news associated with selling more.

### 10.1.2 A formula for Marginal Revenue

We can use a simple formula to compute marginal revenue. The formula quantifies
the good news and bad news from selling one more unit:

$$
\text{marginal revenue} = \text{new price} + (\text{slope of demand curve}
\times \text{old quantity})
$$

The first part of the formula is the good news, the money received for the extra
unit sold. The second part is the bad news from selling one more unit, the
revenue lost by cutting the price for the original customers. The revenue change
equals the price change required to sell one more unitthe slope of the demand
curve, which is a negative numbertimes the number of original customers who get
a price cut.

Suppose the monopolist wants to increase the quantity sold from two to three, so
it cuts the price from $12 to $10. The new price is $10, the old quantity is two
units, and the slope of the demand curve is -$2, so marginal revenue is $6:

$$
\text{marginal revenue} = \$10 - (\$2\text{ per unit} \times 2 \text{ units}) = \$6
$$

Similarly, to sell the fifth unit, the firm would cut the price from $8 to $6,
and marginal revenue is actually negative:

$$
\text{marginal revenue} = \$6 - (\$2 \text{ per unit} \times 4 \text{units} =
-\$2
$$

### 10.1.3 Using the Marginal Principle

A monopolist can use the [marginal principle](ch-2#the-marginal-principle) to decide how much output to
produce.

![Figure 10.2 The monopolist Picks a Quantity and a Price](file:../../../../files/spring-2020/ECON-121/ch-10/ch-10_figure-10.2.png)

> To maximize profit, the monopolist picks point a, where marginal revenue
equals marginal cost. The monopolist produces 900 doses per hour at a price of
$15 (point b). The average cost is $8 (point c), so the profit per dose is $7
(equal to the $15 price minus the $8 average cost) and the total profit is
$6,300 (equal to $7 per dose times 900 doses). The profit is shown by the shaded
rectangle.

| 13            | 1,100                 | 2                    | 7.80              | 14,300                         | 8,560               | 5,740                |
| 12            | 1,200                 | 0                    | 9.00              | 14,400                         | 9,400               | 5,000                |

We can use the marginal-revenue formula explained earlier to compute marginal
revenue for different quantities of output:

$$
\text{marginal revenue} = new price + (\text{slope of demand curve} \times
\text{old quantity})
$$

For example, at a price of $18, the quantity sold is 600 doses, so marginal
revenue is $12:

$$
\text{marginal revenue} = \$18 - (\$0.01 \times \text{600 doses}) = \$12
$$

Similarly, at a price of $15, the quantity is 900 doses and marginal revenue is
$6:

$$
\text{marginal revenue} = \$15 - (\$0.01 \times \text{900 doses}) = \$6
$$

We can compute the firm’s profit in two ways. First, profit equals total revenue
minus total cost:

$$
\text{profit} = \text{total revenue} - \text{total cost} \\
\text{profit} = \text{\$15 per dose} \times \text{900 doses} - \text{\$8 per
dose} \times \text{900 doses} = \$6,300
$$

Second, we can compute the profit per dose and multiply it by the number of
doses:

$$
\text{profit} = \text{profit per dose} \times \text{quantity of doses}
$$

The profit per dose is the price minus the average cost: $\$7 = \$15 - \$8$:

$$
\text{profit} = \text{\$7 per dose} \times \text{900 doses} = \$6,300
$$

Why should the firm stop at 900 doses? Beyond 900 doses, the marginal revenue
from an additional dose will be less than the marginal cost associated with
producing it. Although the firm could cut its price and sell a larger quantity,
an additional dose would add less to revenue than it adds to cost, so the firm’s
total profit would decrease. As shown in the fifth row in the table in Figure
10.2, the firm could sell 1,000 doses at a price of $14, but the marginal
revenue at this quantity is only $4, while the marginal cost at this quantity is
$6.70. Producing the 1,000th dose would decrease the firm’s profit by $2.70.

The three-step process how a monopolist picks a quantity and how to compute the
monopoly profit:

  1. Find the quantity that satisfies the marginal principle, that is, the
     quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In the example
     shown in Figure 10.2, marginal revenue equals marginal cost at point a, so
     the monopolist produces 900 doses.
  2. Using the demand curve, find the price associated with the monopolist’s
     chosen quantity. In Figure 10.2, the price required to sell 900 doses is
     $15 (point b).
  3. Compute the monopolist’s profit. The profit per unit sold equals the price
     minus the average cost, and the total profit equals the profit per unit
     times the number of units sold. In Figure 10.2, the profit is shown by the
     shaded rectangle, with height equal to the profit per unit sold and width
     equal to the number of units sold.
