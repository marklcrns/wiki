# Chapter 8: Production Technology and Cost


## 8.1 Economic Cost and Economic Profit

<a name="economic-profit">**Economic profit**</a>

  - Total revenue minus economic cost.

$$
\text{economic profit} = \text{total revenue} - \text{economic cost}
$$

<a name="economic-cost">**Economic cost**</a>

  - The opportunity cost of the inputs used in the production process; equal to
    explicit cost plus implicit cost.

$$
\text{economic cost} = \text{explicit cost} + \text{implicit cost}
$$

To compute a firm's economic cost, we must determine what the firm sacrifices to
use inputs in the production process. Economic cost is opportunity cost. See
[principle of opportunity cost](ch-2#the-principle-of-opportunity-cost).

Two types of economic cost:

  1. <a name="explicit-cost">**Explicit cost**</a>
  - A monetary payment
  - This is an opportunity cost because money spent on these inputs cannot be
    used to buy something else.

  2. <a name="implicit-cost">**Implicit cost**</a>
  - An opportunity cost that does not involve a monetary payment.
    * e.g., Time, potential interest income.

<a name="accounting-cost">**Accounting cost**</a>

  - The explicit costs of production.
  - Ignores implicit cost

$$
\text{accounting cost} = \text{explicit cost}
$$

<a name="accounting-profit">**Accounting profit**</a>

  - Total revenue minus accounting cost.

$$
\text{accounting profit} = \text{total revenue} - \text{accounting cost}
$$
