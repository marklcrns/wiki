# Chapter 8: Production Technology and Cost


## 8.1 Economic Cost and Economic Profit

<a name="economic-profit">**Economic profit**</a>

  - Total revenue minus economic cost.

$$
\text{economic profit} = \text{total revenue} - \text{economic cost}
$$

<a name="economic-cost">**Economic cost**</a>

  - The opportunity cost of the inputs used in the production process; equal to
    explicit cost plus implicit cost.

$$
\text{economic cost} = \text{explicit cost} + \text{implicit cost}
$$

To compute a firm's economic cost, we must determine what the firm sacrifices to
use inputs in the production process. Economic cost is opportunity cost. See
[principle of opportunity cost](ch-2#the-principle-of-opportunity-cost).

Two types of economic cost:

  1. <a name="explicit-cost">**Explicit cost**</a>
  - A monetary payment
  - This is an opportunity cost because money spent on these inputs cannot be
    used to buy something else.

  2. <a name="implicit-cost">**Implicit cost**</a>
  - An opportunity cost that does not involve a monetary payment.
    * e.g., Time, potential interest income.

<a name="accounting-cost">**Accounting cost**</a>

  - The explicit costs of production.
  - Ignores implicit cost

$$
\text{accounting cost} = \text{explicit cost}
$$

<a name="accounting-profit">**Accounting profit**</a>

  - Total revenue minus accounting cost.

$$
\text{accounting profit} = \text{total revenue} - \text{accounting cost (explicit
cost)}
$$

A firm's accounting cost is always lower than its economic cost, so its
accounting profit is always higher than its economic profit. For the rest of
this book, when we refer to cost and profit, we mean economic cost and economic
profit.

Because accountants ignore implicit costs, accounting profit usually larger than
economic profit.


## 8.2 A Firm with a Fixed Production Facility: Short-Run Costs

### 8.2.1 Production and Marginal Product

<a name="marginal-product-of-labor">**Marginal product of labor**</a>

  - The change in output from one additional unit of labor

This table shows how the quantity of paddles produced varies with
the number of workers.

| Labor | Quantity of Output Produced | Marginal Product of Labor |
|-------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1     | 1                           | 1                         |
| 2     | 5                           | 4                         |
| 3     | 8                           | 3                         |
| 4     | 10                          | 2                         |
| 5     | 11                          | 1                         |
| 6     | 11.5                        | 0.5                       |

Why does the marginal product increase as output increases? When a firm
increases its workforce, workers can specialize in production tasks.
Productivity increases because of the benefits of continuity--each worker spends
less time switching between production tasks. In addition, there are benefits
from repetition--each worker becomes more proficient at an assigned task. A
two-worker operation produces more than twice as many paddles as a one-person
operation because the two workers can specialize, one being responsible for
preparing the plastic for the mold and the other for working the mold.

Starting with the third worker, the production process is subject to
[diminishing returns](ch-2#the-principle-of-diminishing-returns), one of the key
principles of economics. Diminishing returns occur because each worker gets a
smaller share of the production facility.

<a name="total-product-curve">**Total-product curve**</a>

  - A curve showing the relationship between the quantity of labor and the
    quantity of output produced, ceteris paribus.


### 8.2.2 Short-Run Total Cost

<a name="fixed-cost">**Fixed cost (FC)**</a>

  - Cost that does not vary with the quantity produced.

<a name="variable-cost">**Variable cost (VC)**</a>

  - Cost that varies with the quantity produced.

<a name="short-run-total-cost">**Short-run total cost (TC)**</a>

  - The total cost of production when at least one input is fixed; equal to
    fixed cost plus variable cost.

$$
\mathit{TC} = \mathit{FC} + \mathit{VC}
$$

Suppose the opportunity cost of your time is $50 per day, and you can hire
workers for your workshop at the market wage of $50 per day. You can purchase
your workshop, including the building and the paddle mold, for $365,000. If the
interest rate you could have earned on that money is 10 percent per year, the
opportunity cost of tying up your $365,000 in the workshop is $36,500 per year,
or $100 per day.

Table 8.2 Short-Run costs

| Labor | Output (Q) | Fixed Cost (FC) | Variable Cost (VC) | Total Cost (TC) | Average Fixed cost (AFC) | Average Variable Cost (AVC) | Average Total Cost (ATC) | Marginal Cost (MC) |
|-------|------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| 0     | 0          | $100            | $0                 | $100            | -                        | -                           | -                        | -                  |

| 2     | 5          | 100             | 100                | 200             | 20.00                    | 20.00                       | 40.00                    | 12.50              |

### 8.2.3 Short-Run Average Costs

<a name="average-fixed-cost">**Average fixed cost (AFC)**</a>

  - Fixed cost divided by the quantity produced.

$$
\mathit{AFC} = \frac{\mathit{FC}}{Q}
$$

<a name="average-variable-cost">**Average variable cost (AVC)**</a>

  - Variable cost divided by the quantity produced.

$$
\mathit{AVC} = \frac{\mathit{VC}}{\mathit{Q}}
$$

<a name="short-run-average-total-cost">**Short-run average total cost (ATC)**</a>

  - Short-run total cost divided by the quantity produced; equal to AFC plus
    AVC.
  - The short-run average-total-cost curve (ATC) is U-shaped because of the
    conflicting effects of (a) fixed costs being spread over a larger quantity
    of output and (b) diminishing returns.

$$
\mathit{ATC}
\color{#ff0000}{=} \frac{\mathit{TC}}{\mathit{Q}}
\color{#ff0000}{=} \frac{\mathit{FC}}{\mathit{Q}}
+ \frac{\mathit{VC}}{\mathit{Q}}
\color{#ff0000}{=} \mathit{AFC} + \mathit{AVC}
$$

![Figure 8.3](file:../../../../files/spring-2020/ECON-121/ch-8/ch-8_Figure_8.3.png)

The ATC curve in Figure 8.3 is negatively sloped at quantities less than 10
paddles. The negative slope results from two forces that work together to push
average cost down as output increases:

  - **Spreading the fixed cost**. For small quantities of output, a one-unit
    increase in output reduces AFC by a large amount because the fixed cost is
    pretty "thick," being spread over just a few units of output. For example,
    going from one paddle to five paddles decreases AFC from $100 to $20 per
    paddle.

  - **Labor specialization**. For small quantities of output, AVC decreases as
    output increases because labor specialization increases worker productivity.

These two forces both push ATC downward as output increases, so the curve is
negatively sloped for small quantities of output.

### 8.2.4 Short-Run Marginal Cost

<a name="short-run-marginal-cost">**Short-run marginal cost (MC)**</a>

  - The change in short-run total cost resulting from a one-unit increase in
    output.
  - The negatively sloped portion of the short-run marginal-cost curve (MC)
    results from input specialization that causes increasing marginal returns.
  - The positively sloped portion of the MC results from diminishing returns.
  - see [Marginal cost](ch-2#marginal-cost).
  - To calculate marginal cost, take the change in TC with the previous row then
    it by the change in output with the previous row.

$$
\mathit{MC}
= \frac{\Delta \mathit{TC}}{\Delta \mathit{Q}}
= \frac{\text{change in TC}}{\text{change in output}}
$$

Whenever the **marginal cost is less than the average cost**, the **average cost
will fall**; whenever the **marginal cost exceeds the average cost**, the
**average will rise**; and whenever the **marginal cost equals the average
cost**, the **average will not change**.

### 8.2.5 The Relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Cost

![Figure 8.4](file:../../../../files/spring-2020/ECON-121/ch-8/ch-8_Figure_8.4.png)


## 8.3 Production and Cost in the Long Run

The key difference between the short run and the long run is that there are no
diminishing returns in the long run. Recall that
[diminishing returns](ch-2#the-principle-of-diminishing-returns) occur because
workers share a fixed production facility, so the larger the number of workers
in the facility, the smaller the share of the facility available for each
worker. In the long run, a firm can expand its production facility as its
workforce grows, so there are no diminishing returns.

### 8.3.1 Expansion and Replication

In order to effectively double the output of your production, one possibility is
to double the original operation or to build an identical operation from the
original.

<a name="long-run-total-cost">**Long-run total cost (LTC)**</a>

  - The total cost of production when a firm is perfectly flexible in choosing
    its inputs.

![Figure 8.5](file:../../../../files/spring-2020/ECON-121/ch-8/ch-8_Figure_8.5.png)

| Labor | Capital | Output | Labor Cost | Long-run Total Cost (LTC) | Long-run Average Cost (LAC) |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1     | $100    | 1      | $50        | $150                      | $150                        |
| 2     | 100     | 5      | 100        | 200                       | 40                          |
| 4     | 100     | 10     | 200        | 300                       | 30                          |
| 8     | 200     | 20     | 400        | 600                       | 30                          |
| 12    | 300     | 30     | 600        | 900                       | 30                          |

<a name="long-run-average-cost">**Long-run average cost (LAC)**</a>

  - The long-run cost divided by the quantity produced.
  - The long-run average-cost curve (LAC) is horizontal over some range of
    output because replication is an option, so doubling output will no more
    than double long-run total cost.
  - The LAC is negatively sloped for small quantities of output because (a)
    there are indivisible inputs that cannot be scaled down and (b) a smaller
    operation has limited opportunities for labor specialization.

$$
\mathit{LAC} = \frac{\mathit{LTC}}{Q}
$$

<a name="constant-returns-to-scale">**Constant returns to scale**</a>

  - A situation in which the long-run total cost increases proportionately with
    output, so average cost is constant.
  - Horizontal part of the curve

<a name="long-run-marginal-cost">**Long-run marginal cost (LMC)**</a>

  - The change in long-run cost resulting from a one-unit increase in output.

$$
\mathit{LMC} = \frac{\Delta \mathit{LTC}}{\Delta \mathit{Q}}
$$

### 8.3.2 Reducing Output with Indivisible Inputs

What would happen if you decide to produce only 5 paddles per day instead of 10?
Although it's tempting to think that your total costs would be cut in half,
that's not necessarily the case. Remember that you use a single mold to produce
10 paddles per day. If you cut your output in half, you would still need the
mold, so your capital costs won't be cut in half. In addition, if each mold
requires a fixed amount of floor space, you would still need the same floor
space. Therefore, cutting output in half wouldn't decrease the cost of your
production facility at all. You would still have a cost of $100 per day for the
mold and the workspace.

<a name="indivisible-input">**Indivisible input**</a>

  - An input that cannot be scaled down to produce a smaller quantity of output.

Mold is an example of an indivisible input.

### 8.3.3 Scaling Down and Labor Specialization

A second possible reason for higher average long-run costs in a smaller
operation is that labor will be less specialized in the small operation. As we
saw earlier in the chapter, labor specialization--each worker specializing in an
individual production task--makes workers more productive because of continuity
and repetition. Reversing this process, when we reduce the workforce each worker
will become less specialized, performing a wider variety of production tasks.
The loss of specialization will decrease labor productivity, leading to higher
average cost.

### 8.3.4 Economies of Scale

<a name="economies-of-scale-term">**Economies of scale**</a>

  - A situation in which the long-run average cost of production decreases as
    output increases.
  - Downward-sloping part of the curve

One way to quantify the extent of scale economies in the production of a
particular good is to determine the minimum efficient scale for producing the
good.

<a name="minimum-efficient-scale">**Minimum efficient scale**</a>

  - The output at which scale economies are exhausted.

  If a firm starts out with a quantity of output below the minimum efficient
  scale, an increase in output will decrease the average cost. Once the minimum
  efficient scale has been reached, the average cost no longer decreases as
  output increases.

### 8.3.5 Diseconomies of Scale

<a name="diseconomies-of-scale">**Diseconomies of scale**</a>

  - A situation in which the long-run average cost of production increases as
    output increases.
  - Upward-sloping part of the curve

Diseconomies of scale can occur for two reasons:

  - **Coordination problems**. One of the problems of a large organization is
    that it requires several layers of management to coordinate the activities
    of the different parts of the organization. A large organization requires
    more meetings, reports, and administrative work, leading to higher unit
    cost. If an increase in the firm's output requires additional layers of
    management, the long-run average-cost curve may be positively sloped.

  - **Increasing input costs**. When a firm increases its output, it will demand
    more of each of its inputs and may be forced to pay higher prices for some
    of these inputs.

For example, an expanding construction firm may be forced to pay higher
wages to attract more workers. Alternatively, an expanding firm may be
forced to hire workers who are less skilled than the original workers. An
increase in wages or a decrease in productivity will increase the average
cost of production, generating a positively sloped long-run average-cost
curve.


## Chapter Summary

Here are the main points of the chapter:

  1. The negatively sloped portion of the short-run _marginal-cost curve_ (MC)
     results from input specialization that causes increasing marginal returns.
  2. The positively sloped portion of the MC results from _diminishing
     returns_.
  3. The short-run _average-total-cost curve_ (ATC) is U-shaped because of the
     conflicting effects of (a) fixed costs being spread over a larger quantity
     of output and (b) diminishing returns.
  4. The long-run _average-cost curve_ (LAC) is horizontal over some range of
     output because replication is an option, so doubling output will no more
     than double long-run total cost.
  5. The LAC is negatively sloped for small quantities of output because (a)
     there are indivisible inputs that cannot be scaled down and (b) a smaller
     operation has limited opportunities for labor specialization.
  6. _Diseconomies of scale_ arise if there are problems in coordinating a
     large operation or higher input costs in a larger organization.

The short run is a period of time where **at least one input is fixed**, while
the long run is a period of time where **all inputs are variable**.
