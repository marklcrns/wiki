# Chapter 8: Production Technology and Cost


## 8.1 Economic Cost and Economic Profit

<a name="economic-profit">**Economic profit**</a>

  - Total revenue minus economic cost.

$$
\text{economic profit} = \text{total revenue} - \text{economic cost}
$$

<a name="economic-cost">**Economic cost**</a>

  - The opportunity cost of the inputs used in the production process; equal to
    explicit cost plus implicit cost.

$$
\text{economic cost} = \text{explicit cost} + \text{implicit cost}
$$

To compute a firm's economic cost, we must determine what the firm sacrifices to
use inputs in the production process. Economic cost is opportunity cost. See
[principle of opportunity cost](ch-2#the-principle-of-opportunity-cost).

Two types of economic cost:

  1. <a name="explicit-cost">**Explicit cost**</a>
  - A monetary payment
  - This is an opportunity cost because money spent on these inputs cannot be
    used to buy something else.

  2. <a name="implicit-cost">**Implicit cost**</a>
  - An opportunity cost that does not involve a monetary payment.
    * e.g., Time, potential interest income.

<a name="accounting-cost">**Accounting cost**</a>

  - The explicit costs of production.
  - Ignores implicit cost

$$
\text{accounting cost} = \text{explicit cost}
$$

<a name="accounting-profit">**Accounting profit**</a>

  - Total revenue minus accounting cost.

$$
\text{accounting profit} = \text{total revenue} - \text{accounting cost}
$$

### 8.2.1 Production and Marginal Product

<a name="marginal-product-of-labor">**Marginal product of labor**</a>

  - The change in output from one additional unit of labor

This table shows how the quantity of paddles produced varies with
the number of workers.

| Labor | Quantity of Output Produced | Marginal Product of Labor |
|-------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1     | 1                           | 1                         |
| 2     | 5                           | 4                         |
| 3     | 8                           | 3                         |
| 4     | 10                          | 2                         |
| 5     | 11                          | 1                         |
| 6     | 11.5                        | 0.5                       |

Why does the marginal product increase as output increases? When a firm
increases its workforce, workers can specialize in production tasks.
Productivity increases because of the benefits of continuity--each worker spends
less time switching between production tasks. In addition, there are benefits
from repetition--each worker becomes more proficient at an assigned task. A
two-worker operation produces more than twice as many paddles as a one-person
operation because the two workers can specialize, one being responsible for
preparing the plastic for the mold and the other for working the mold.

Starting with the third worker, the production process is subject to
[diminishing returns](ch-2#the-principle-of-diminishing-returns), one of the key
principles of economics. Diminishing returns occur because each worker gets a
smaller share of the production facility.

  - A curve showing the relationship between the quantity of labor and the
    quantity of output produced, ceteris paribus.
