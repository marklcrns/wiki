# Chapter 2: The Key Principles of Economics

In this chapter, **five key principles** that provide a foundation for economic
analysis will be introduced.

**Principle**

  - A self evident truth that most people readily understand and accept.

## 2.1 The Principle of Opportunity Cost

> The Opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.

Economics is all about making choices, and to make good choices we must compare
the benefit of something to its cost.

**Opportunity cost**

  - What you sacrifice to get something.

For every decision we do, the benefits of the decision should exceed the
opportunity cost of the trade-off.

> No matter what we do, there is always a trade-off.

## 2.2 The Marginal Principle

> Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its
marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit equals the
marginal cost.

Economists think in marginal terms, considering how a one-unit change in one
variable affects the value of another variable and people's decisions.

The marginal principle is based on a comparison of the marginal benefits and
marginal costs of a particular activity.

**Marginal benefit**

  - The additional benefit resulting from a small increase in some activity.

**Marginal cost**

  - The additional cost resulting from a small increase in some activity.

For example, if the marginal benefit is $80 of additional revenue and the
marginal cost is $30 of additional expense for workers and utilities, staying
open for the additional hour increases the bookstore's profit by $50.

> When we reach the level where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost,
we cannot do any better, and the fine-tuning is done.

## The Principle of Voluntary Exchange

> A voluntary exchange between two people makes both people better off.
