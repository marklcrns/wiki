# Chapter 9: Perfect Competition

<a name="perfectly-competitive-market">**Perfectly competitive market**</a>

  - A market with many sellers and buyers of a homogeneous product and no
    barriers to entry.
  - Five features of a competitive market
    1. There are many sellers.
    2. There are many buyers.
    3. The product is homogeneous.
    4. There are no barriers to market entry.
    5. Both buyers and sellers are price takers.

<a name="price-taker">**Price taker**</a>

  - A buyer or seller that takes the market price as given.
    * For example, each soybean farmer takes the market price as given. There is
      no reason to cut the price to sell more soybeans, because the farmer can
      sell as much as he wants at the market price. There is no reason to
      increase the price because the farmer would lose all his customers to
      other farmers selling at the market price.


## 9.1 Previous of the Four Market Structures

<a name="firm-specific-demand-curve">**Firm-specific demand curve**</a>

  - A curve showing the relationship between the price charged by a specific
    firm and the quantity the firm can sell.
  - In a _monopoly_, a single firm serves the entire market, so the
    firm-specific demand curve is the same as the market demand curve.
  - A _perfectly competitive firm_ can sell as much as it wants at the market
    price, but if it raises its price even a penny, it will sell nothing.
    [Perfectly elastic](ch-5#perfectly-elastic-demand).

> In Panel A, the demand curve facing a monopolist is the market demand curve.
In Panel B, a perfectly competitive firm takes the market price as given, so the
firm-specific demand curve is horizontal. The firm can sell all it wants at the
market price, but would sell nothing if it charged a higher price.

<a name="monopoly">**Monopoly**</a>

  - A single firm serves the entire market. A monopoly occurs when the barriers
    to market entry are very large. This can result from very large economies of
    scale or a government policy that limits the number of firms. Some examples
    of monopolies that result from large economies of scale are local phone
    service, cable TV, and electric power transmission. Some examples of
    monopolies established by government policy are drugs covered by patents,
    the selling of firewood in national parks, and the U.S. Postal Service.

<a name="monopolistic-competition">**Monopolistic competition**</a>

  - There are no barriers to entering the market, so there are many firms, and
    each firm sells a slightly different product. For example, coffee shops in
    your city provide slightly different goods and compete for customers. Your
    local grocery store sells many brands of toothbrushes, with slight
    differences in size, shape, color, and style.

<a name="oligopoly">**Oligopoly**</a>

  - The market consists of just a few firms because [economies of scale](ch-8#economies-of-scale) or
    government policies limit the number of firms. Some product examples are
    automobiles, computer processor chips, airline travel, and breakfast
    cereals. The large economies of scale in automobile production result from
    the large startup costs, with billions of dollars required to build a
    factory or assembly plant. Similarly, a fabrication plant for computer
    processor chips costs several billion dollars.

## 9.2 The Firm's Short-Run Output Decision

### 9.2.1 The Total Approach: Computing Total Revenue and Total Cost

![Figure 9.2](file:../../../../files/spring-2020/ECON-121/ch-9/ch-9_figure-9.2.png)

> Economic profit is shown by the vertical distance between the total-revenue
curve and the total-cost curve. To maximize profit, the firm chooses the
quantity of output that generates the largest vertical difference between the
two curves.

### 9.2.2 The Marginal Approach

The other way for a firm to decide how much output to produce relies on the
[marginal principle](ch-2#the-marginal-principle), the general decision-making rule that is one of the key
principles of economics.

<a name="marginal-revenue">**Marginal revenue**</a>

  - The change in total revenue from selling one more unit of output.

A perfectly competitive firm takes the market price as given, so the marginal
revenue--the change in total revenue from one more shirt--is simply the price:

$$
\text{marginal revenue} = \text{price}
$$

The marginal principle tells us that the firm will maximize its profit by
choosing the quantity at which price equals marginal cost:

$$
\text{To maximize profit, produce the quantity where price} = \text{marginal
cost}
$$

![Figure 9.3](file:../../../../files/spring-2020/ECON-121/ch-9/ch-9_figure-9.3.png)

> A perfectly competitive firm takes the market price as given, so the marginal
benefit, or marginal revenue, equals the price. Using the marginal principle,
the typical firm will maximize profit at point $a$, where the $12 market price
equals the marginal cost. Economic profit equals the difference between the
price and the average cost ($4.125=$12âˆ’$7.875) times the quantity produced
(eight shirts per minute), or $33 per minute.

### 9.2.3 Economic Profit and the Break-Even Price

We've seen that the perfectly competitive firm maximizes its profit by producing
the quantity at which its marginal revenue (price) equals its marginal cost. How
much profit does the firm earn? The firm's economic profit equals its total
revenue minus its total cost. One way to compute a firm's total economic profit
is to multiply the average profit per unit produced--the gap between the price
and the average cost--by the quantity produced:

$$
\text{economic profit} = (\text{price} - \text{average cost}) \times
\text{quantity produced}
$$

How would a decrease in price affect the firm's output decision? A decrease in
price shifts the marginal-revenue (price) line downward, so it will intersect
the marginal-cost curve at a smaller quantity.

This is the [law of supply](ch-4#law-of-supply) in action: The lower the price, the smaller the
quantity supplied.

<a name="break-even-price">**Break-even price**</a>

  - The price at which economic profit is zero; price equals average total cost.
