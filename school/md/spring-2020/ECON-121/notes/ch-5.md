# Chapter 5: Elasticity: A Measure of Responsiveness

## 5.1 The Price Elasticity of Demand

**Price elasticity of demand ($E_d$)**

  -  A measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to changes in
     price; equal to the absolute values of the percentage change in quantity
     demanded.

$$
E_{d} = \left |\frac{\text{percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{percentage change in price}}\right |
$$

When the price elasticity is listed as a positive number, the interpretation of
the elasticity is straightforward. If the elasticity number is large, it means
that the demand for the product is very elastic, or very responsive to changes
in price. In contrast, a small number indicates that the demand for a product is
very inelastic.

### Computing Percentage Changes and Elasticities

Two ways to compute percentage change:

For example, if a price increases from $20 to $22.

**Using the initial-value method**

$$
\text{percent change with initial value} = \frac{22 - 20}{20} \cdot 100 = \frac{2}{20} \cdot 100 = 10\%
$$

**Using the midpoint method**

$$
\text{percentage change with midpoint value} = \frac{2}{\frac{20 + 22}{2}} \cdot 100 = \frac{2}{21} \cdot 100 = 9.52\%
$$

The advantage of the midpoint approach is that it generates the same absolute
percentage change whether the variable has increased or decreased. The reason is
that the denominator is the same in both cases. In contrast, the initial-value
computation is based on the initial value, so our answer there depends on the
direction of the change--which of the two values is the initial value.

### 5.1.2 Price Elasticity and the Demand Curve

**Elastic demand**

  - The price elasticity of demand is greater than one, so the percentage change
    in quantity exceeds the percentage change in price.
  - When the price elasticity is greater than 1.0, we say that demand is
    _elastic_, or highly responsive to changes in price.
    * e.g. Restaurant meals, air travel and movies.

**Inelastic demand**

  - The price elasticity of demand is less than one, so the percentage change in
    quantity is less than the percentage change in price.
  - When the elasticity is less than 1.0, we say that demand is _inelastic_, or
    not very responsive to changes in price.
    * e.g. Salt, eggs, coffee and cigarettes.

**Unit elastic demand**

  - The price elasticity of demand is one, so the percentage change in quantity
    equals the percentage change in price.
    * e.g. Housing and fruit juice.

**Perfectly inelastic demand**

  - The price elasticity of demand is zero.
  - When demand is _perfectly inelastic_, the quantity doesn't change as the price
    changes, so the demand curve is vertical at the fixed quantity.
  - This extreme case is rare because for most products, consumers can either
    switch to a substitute good or do without.
    * e.g. Medicines such as insulin for diabetics that have no substitutes.

**Perfectly elastic demand**

  - The price elasticity of demand is infinite.
  - In the case of perfect elasticity, the price elasticity is infinite and the
    demand curve is horizontal, meaning that only one price is possible.
    * e.g. Each wheat farmer can sell as much as he or she wants at the market
      price but would sell nothing at any price above the market price.

### 5.1.3 Elasticity and the Availability of Substitutes

The key factor in determining the price elasticity for a particular product is
the availability of substitute products.

Consider the substitution possibilities for insulin and cornflakes. There are no
good substitutes for insulin, so diabetics are not very responsive to changes in
price. When the price of insulin increases, they cannot switch to another
medicine, so the demand for insulin is inelastic. In contrast, there are many
substitutes for cornflakes, including different types of corn cereals, as well
as cereals made from wheat, rice, and oats. Faced with an increase in the price
of cornflakes, consumers can easily switch to substitute products, so the demand
for cornflakes is relatively elastic.

The availability of substitutes increases over time, so the longer the time
consumers have to respond to a price change, the more elastic the demand.
Because it often takes time for consumers to respond to price changes, the
short-run price elasticity of demand is typically smaller than the long-run
elasticity. For example, when the price of gasoline increases, consumers can
immediately drive fewer miles in their existing cars or switch to public
transportation. As shown in Table 5.2, the short-run price elasticity of demand
for gasoline is 0.25. In the long run, consumers can buy more fuel-efficient
cars and move closer to workplaces. As time passes, consumers have more options
to cut gasoline consumption--more substitution possibilities--so demand becomes
more elastic.

|              | Specific brands of coffee | 5.6                        |

### 5.1.4 Other Determinants of the Price Elasticity of Demand

Two other factors help determine the price elasticity of demand for a product:


**Consumer Budget**

  - If a good represents a small part of the budget of the typical consumer,
    demand is relatively inelastic. For example, suppose the price of pencils is
    20 cents and then increases by 10 percent, or 2 cents. Because the price
    change is tiny compared to the income of the typical consumer, we would
    expect a relatively small decrease in the quantity of pencils demanded.In
    contrast, if the price of a car is $20,000 and then increases 10 percent
    ($2,000), we would expect a bigger response because the change in price is
    large relative to the income of the typical consumer.

**Necessity or a luxury good**

  - The demand for food, a necessity, is relatively low in both wealthy and poor
    countries. Similarly, the demand for physician visits is inelastic
    (elasticity=0.25). In contrast, the elasticity of demand for luxury goods
    such as restaurant meals, foreign travel, and motorboats is relatively
    elastic.

Determinants of Elasticity

| Factor                      | Demand is relatively elastic if ... | Demand is relatively inelastic of ... |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Availability of substitutes | there are many substitutes.         | there are few substitutes.            |
| Passage of time             | a long time passes.                 | a short time passes.                  |
| Fraction of consumer        | is large.                           | is small.                             |
| Necessity                   | the product is a luxury.            | the product is a necessity.           |

## 5.2 Using Price Elasticity

### 5.2.1 Predicting Changes in Quantity

If we have values for two of the three variables in the elasticity formula, we
can compute the value of the third. The three variables are (1) the price
elasticity of demand itself, (2) the percentage change in quantity, and (3) the
percentage change in price.

**Elasticity Formula**
$$
\text{percentage change in quantity demanded} = \text{percentage change in price} \times E_d
$$

### 5.2.2 Price Elasticity and Total Revenue

**Total revenue**

  - The money a firm generates from selling its product.

$$
\text{total revenue} = \text{price per unit} \times  \text{quantity sold}
$$

Suppose a firm increases the price of its product. Will its total sales revenue
increase or decrease? The answer depends on the price elasticity of demand for
the product. If you know the price elasticity, you can determine whether a price
hike will increase or decrease the firm's total revenue.

  - _Elastic demand_. The relationship between price and total revenue is
    negative: An increase in price decreases total revenue; a decrease in price
    increases total revenue.
  - _Inelastic demand_. The relationship between price and total revenue is
    positive: An increase in price increases total revenue; a decrease in price
    decreases total revenue.
  - _Unit elastic demand_. Total revenue does not vary with price.


$$
\text{Elastic Demand:} E_d > 1.0
$$
| if price ... | Total revenue ... | Because the percentage change in quantity is ... |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| $\uparrow$   | $\downarrow$      | Larger than the percentage change in price.      |
| $\downarrow$ | $\uparrow$        | Larger than the percentage change in price.      |

$$
\text{Inelastic Demand:} E_d < 1.0
$$

| if price ... | Total revenue ... | Because the percentage change in quantity is ... |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| $\uparrow$   | $\uparrow$        | Smaller than the percentage change in price.     |
| $\downarrow$ | $\downarrow$      | Smaller than the percentage change in price.     |
