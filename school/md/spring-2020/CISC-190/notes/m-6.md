# Module 6: Creating Your Own Classes

## Chapter 11: Creating Classes

### 11.2 Defining A Class

```java
public class Student
{
  \\ some code here
}
```

or
```java
public class Student {
  \\ some code here
}
```

This class **MUST** be saved in a file called `Student.java`

#### 11.2.1 Defining Fields

Inside a class, we declare fields by specifying the `visibility`, `type`, and
`name` of the filed.

_visibility type name;_
```java
private String name;
```

We can also specify an initial value for the field as the result of some
expression.

_visibility type name = expression;_
```java
private String name = "Unknown";
```

The `visibility` for fields is usually `private` so that an object can control
its own data.

The `type` is a class name if the field is an object or one of the primitive
types (`int`, `double`, `boolean,` etc). Remember that you can declare an array
by adding `[]` after the type. You can have arrays of primitives or objects.

The `name` should be appropriate for  what field represents. The convention for
fields names is to _start with a lowercase letter and uppercase the first letter
of additional word_.

Fields are _automatically_ initialized if no other initialization is specified
in the declaration. The default is to initialize object references to `null`,
numbers to `0`, and boolean variables to `false`.

Program 95: A Student Class
```java
public class Student
{
  ///////////// fields ////////////////
  private String name;
  private double[] gradeArray;
}
```

#### 11.2.2 Inherited Methods

Every class inherits all the methods from the class `Object`.

You could explicitly name the parent class by using the `extends` keyword on the
class definition followed by the name of the parent class.


```java
public class Student extends Object
{
}
```

The parent class (`Object`) is the class the child class (`Student`) is
inheriting from.

> The parent class is also called _superclass_ or a _base class_. While the
child class is also called a _subclass_ or a _derived class_.

A class is only allow to have **ONE** parent class, and if none is specified the
default will be `Object`.

> When you call the method `System.out.println` and pass it any object, the
runtime environment will execute the method `toString()` on that object. If the
class has a `toString()` method, it will execute the method over from the child
class instead of the parent class' `toString()`.

Because each objects keeps a reference to its class, you can get its class using
the `getClass()` method inherited from the `Student` class. To get the parent
class instead, use `getSuperclass()`

#### 11.2.3 Overriding Inherited Methods

Creating a method with the same _method signature_ (method name and parameter
list) as a parent method, will result in that method being called _instead of_
the method defined in the parent. This is called _overriding_ a method.

![Figure 11.3](file:../../../../files/spring-2020/CISC-190/module-6/cisc-190_ch-11_figure-11.3.png)

Program 96: Student Class with a Method

```java
public class Student
{
  //////////// fields ////////////
  private String name;
  private double[] gradeArray;

  //////////// methods ////////////
  public String toString()
  {
    return "Student object named: " + this.name;
  }
}
```

> You use `this` keyword to refer thee the current object inside of a method.

If you create a student object and print it out you will get:

```java
> System.out.println(new Student());
Student object named: null
```

#### 11.2.4 Default Field Initialization

When an object is created, _all_ of the fields of the object are initialized.
Object fields that aren't explicitly initialized by assignment statements in the
declaration will be `null`, number fields will be `0`, and bollean fields will
be `false`.

#### 11.2.5 Declaring Constructors

A constructor is automatically called after a new object is created using the
_new_ operator. The constructor sets up the object, which usually means
initializing the fields.

If the compiler doesn't see any constructors, it creates one that doesn't take
any parameters and doesn't change the value of the fields. A constructor that
doesn't take any parameters is called the _no argument constructor_.

```java
visibility ClassName(paramList)
```

> Constructors usually have `public` visibility.<br>
> Constructors **DOESN'T HAVE** a return type. Return type is only for methods.

Program 97: Student Class with a Constructor

```java
public class Student
{
  //////////// fields //////////////////
  private String name;
  private double[] gradeArray;

  //////////// constructors ///////////
  public Student(String theName)
  {
    this.name = theName;
  }

  /////////// methods ///////////////
  public String toString()
  {
    return "Student object named: " + this.name;
  }
}
```

```java
// with argument constructor
> System.out.println(new Student("Amy Clark");
Student object named: Amy Clark
// with no argument constructor
> System.out.println(new Student());
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: Student constructor
```

Since theres one constructor in the class Student, the compiler will no longer
add the no argument constructor that leaves all the field values alone:

Program 98: Studnet Class with Multiple Constructors

```java
public class Student
{
  //////////// fields //////////////////
  private String name;
  private double[] gradeArray;

  //////////// constructors ///////////
  public Student() {}

  public Student(String theName)
  {
    this.name = theName;
  }

  /////////// methods ///////////////
  public String toString()
  {
    return "Student object named: " + this.name;
  }
}
```

### 11.3 Overloading Constructors

Program 99: Student Class with Three Constructors
```java
public class Student
{
  //////////// fields //////////////////
  private String name;
  private double[] gradeArray;

  //////////// constructors ///////////
  public Student() {}

  public Student(String theName)
  {
    this.name = theName;
  }

  public Student(String theName, double[] theGradeArray)
  {
    this.name = theName;
    this.gradeArray = theGradeArray;
  }

  /////////// methods ///////////////
  public String toString()
  {
    return "Student object named: " + this.name;
  }
```

### 11.4 Creating And Initializing An Array

#### 11.4.1 Calculating the Grade Average

Program 100: Student Class with Average Calculation

```java
public class Student
{
  //////////// fields //////////////////
  private String name;
  private double[] gradeArray;

  //////////// constructors ///////////
  public Student() {}

  public Student(String theName)
  {
    this.name = theName;
  }

  public Student(String theName, double[] theGradeArray)
  {
    this.name = theName;
    this.gradeArray = theGradeArray;
  }

  /////////// methods ///////////////
  public double getAverage()
  {
    double average = 0.0;

    if (this.gradeArray != null && this.gradeArray.length > 0)
    {
      double sum = 0.0;
      for (int i = 0; i < this.gradeArray.length; i++)
      {
        sum = sum + this.gradeArray[i];
      }
      average = sum / this.gradeArray.length;
    }
    return average;
  }

  public String toString()
  {
    return "Student object named: " + this.name;
  }
}
```

```java
> double[] gArray = {80, 90, 95, 87, 98};
> System.out.println(new Student("Ron Farmer", gArray));
Student object named: Ron Farmer Average: 90.0
```

##### 11.4.2 Using Step Into in the Debugger

  - <kbd>STEP INTO</kbd> will take us _into_ a method which is invoked on the
    current line.

  - <kbd>STEP OVER</kbd> would just execute the method and stop after it. We
    wouldn't get to see what happens _inside_ the method.

  - <kbd>STEP OUT</kbd> gets you out from the inside of a method and stop at the
    line following the line that called the current method.

### 11.5 Creating Accessors (Getters) And Modifiers (Setters)

We can access public fields using dot notation: _objectRef.fieldName_ or
`gradeArray.length`.

> `private` fields **CANNOT** be accessed without accessors (getters).

#### 11.5.1 Creating Accessors (Getters)

In order to let objects of other classes access the information in private
fields, we need to create public methods that access the private fields.
**Accessors** are methods that return private field information. By convention
these are declared as:

```java
public type getFieldName()
```

For example, this method will return the value of the _name_:

```java
public String getName() { return this.name; }
```

This method returns the array of grades:

```java
public double getGrade(int index)
{
  return this.gradeArray[index];
}
```

#### 11.5.2 Creating Modifiers (Setters)

Methods that modify fields are called **modifiers** or **mutators**. The Java
convention is to declare these as follows:

```java
public returnType setFieldName(type param1Name,
                               type param2Name, ...)
```

For example, this method tries to change the grade stored at a passed index to a
passed new grade:

```java
public boolean setGrade(int index, double newGrade)
{
  if (newGrade <0 || this.gradeArray == null)
    return false;
  else
  {
    this.gradeArray[index] = newGrade;
    return true;
  }
}
```

If the no argument constructor or the constructor that just takes the name was
used to create a Student object, the grade array will be null. We need some way
to set it. One way is to pass the grade array to use. We can decide to only
allow this if the grade array is currently null.

```java
public boolean setGradeArray(double[] theArray)
{
  if (this.gradeArray != null)
  {
    return false;
  }
  else
  {
    this.gradeArray = theArray;
    return true;
  }
}
```

Here is a method that will set the student's name only if it is currently null;
otherwise it will leave the current name alone. It will return true if the name
is changed and false otherwise.

```java
public boolean setName(String theName)
{
  boolean result = false;
  if (this.name == null)
  {
    this.name = theName;
    result = true;
  }
  return result;
}
```

One of the advantages of object-oriented programming is that the data and
methods are _encapsulated_ in the class definition. This means that the data is
grouped with the methods that affect it inside of a class. If the data get into
an incorrect state, we know immediately that the class isn't doing its job of
protecting the data.

### 11.6 Creating A Main Method

`main` method is a special method that you can use to create objects and invoke
methods. A main method must have the following method declaration:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

> The convention is just to use the name `args`. It doesn't matter if you call the
array of string args or some other name.<br>
> It must be a `public` method so that it can be called by objects of other
classes.<br>
>It must be `static` because no objects of the class exist when you start
execution of the method.

Here is a main method that you can use to create some students:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  Student student1 = new Student("Barb Ericson");
  System.out.print(student1);
  double[] gradeArray1 = {90, 88, 95, 96, 93};
  Student student2 = new Student("Mark Guzdial", gradeArrray);
  System.out.print(student2);
}
```

### 11.7 Javadoc Comments

#### 11.7.1 Class Comment

Example of a class comment

```java
/**
 * Class that describes a student. A student has a name and an
 * array of grades. You can get information about a student
 * such as her/his name and grade average.
 *
 * @author Barb Ericson
 */
public class Student
```

Notice that the Javadoc comment is just before the class declaration. It tells
something about the purpose of the class. It also should tell who the author or
authors are. If there is more than one author you just add another `@author`
tag. The `@author` tag is just one of many special tags defined in Javadoc that
will pull particular information out of the source code and format it in the
HTML documentation.

### 11.7.2 Method Comments

Example of a method comment

```java
/**
 * Method to set a grade in the grade array
 * @param index the index to set the grade at
 * @param newGrade the new grade to use
 * @return true if success, else false
 */
public boolean setGrade(int index, double newGrade)
{
  ...
}
```

#### 11.7.3 Constructor Comments

You can add Javadoc comments to constructors as well. They look like method
comments. Of course you won't need any `@return` tags since constructors do not
return a value.

#### 11.7.4 Generating the Documentation

Once you add Javadoc comments to your class you can generate HTML documentation
in DrJava by clicking on the <kbd>JAVADOC</kbd> button.

### 11.8 Creating Another Class

What if we want to represent a class period? We might want to keep track of the
teacher's name, the period number, and the students in that period.

```java
/**
 * ClassPeriod represents a class period which has a teacher,
 * a period number, and an array of students
 */
public class ClassPeriod
{
  ///////////////// fields ///////////////////
  private String teacherName;
  private int periodNumber;
  private Student[] studentArray = new Student[35];
}
```

![Figure 11.3](file:../../../../files/spring-2020/CISC-190/module-6/cisc-190_ch-11_figure-11.16.png)

<a name="unified-modeling-language">**Unified modeling language (UML)**</a>

  - A class diagram that shows each class in a rectangular box and relationships
    between classes with lines.
  - A straight line (perhaps with an arrow at one end) shows an association
    between two classes.
  - A straight line ending with an open triangle indicates inheritance
  - The open triangle is at the parent class end.

The standard way to show object-oriented designs is to use a UML class diagram.
In Figure 11.16, we see that we have two classes in our design so far: `Student`
and `ClassPeriod` and that both of these inherit from the class `Object`. There
is a line connecting Student and `ClassPeriod` with an arrow pointing to the
`Student` class. This means that a `ClassPeriod` object will keep track of the
`Student` objects in it. The '*' at the end of the line near the `Student` class
shows us that a `ClassPeriod` object can have 0 to many `Student` objects associated
with it. The '5...8' at the `ClassPeriod` end means that a `Student` object can have
five to eight `ClassPeriod` object associated with it.

#### 11.8.1 Adding Constructors

```java
/////////////// constructors //////////////////
/**
 * No-argument constructor. Leaves fields with
 * default values.
 */
public ClassPeriod() {}

/**
 * Constructor that takes just the teacher's name
 * @param name the name for the teacher
 */
public ClassPeriod(String name) { this.teacherName = name; }

/**
 * Constructor that takes the teacher's name and period number
 * @param name the name for the teacher
 * @param num the number for the class period
 */
public ClassPeriod(String name, int num)
{
  this.teacherName = name;
  this.periodNumber = num;
}
```

#### 11.8.2 Adding Accessors and Modifiers

Accessors (Getters)

```java
//////////////////// methods ////////////////////
/**
 * Method to get the teacher's name
 * @return the name of the teacher, or null if none yet
 */
public String getTeacherName() { return teacherName; }

/**
 * Method to get a student based on the index
 * @return the student at this index or null if none at this
 * index
 */
public Student getStudent(int index)
{
  return studentArray[index];
}
```

Modifiers (Setters)

```java
/**
 * Method to set the teacher's name
 * @param name the name to use
 */
public void setTeacherName(String name)
{
  this.teacherName = name;
}

/**
 * Method to set the period number (if it hasn't been set)
 * @param num the number to use
 * @return flag to say if set worked
 */
public boolean setPeriodNumber(int num)
{
  if (this.periodNumber == 0)
  {
    this.periodNumber = nu;
    return true;
  }
  else return false;
}

/**
 * Method to set the student at an index
 * @param studentObj the student object to use
 * @param index the index to set the student at
 */
public void setStudent(Student studentObj, int index)
{
  this.studentArray[index] = studentObj;
}
```

### 11.9 Reusing A Class Via Inheritance

In section 11.2.2, we saw that you can specify the parent class when you declare
a class using the extends keyword. If you don't specify the parent class the
parent class will be `Object`.

```java
public class ConfusedTurtle extends Turtle
{
  /**
   * Method to turn right (but a confused
   * turtle will actually turn left)
   */
  public void turnRight()
  {
    super.turnLeft();
  }
}
```
