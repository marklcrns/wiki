# Module 2: Writing Methods

**Visibility (access member/modifier)**

  - `public`: having a public access member means that the method can be invoked
    by any code in any class definition.
  - `private` having a private access member means that the method can ONLY be
    accessed from inside the class definition.

**Return type**

  - Every method requires a return type to be declared when creating a method.
    * `void` -- Lets the method get away without a return value.
    * `int` -- Method declaration that should return an integer value.
    * `String` -- Method declaration that should return a String value.

**Method overloading**

  - Java allows you to use the same method name as another method as long as the
    parameter list is different.

> One of the advantages to Java is that the ".class" files aren't specific to
any particular type of computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux). They can be understood
by any computer that has a Java run-time environment.
