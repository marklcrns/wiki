# Module 5: Conditional Execution

## Chapter 6: Conditionally Modifying Pixels

  - [Chapter 6: Conditionally Modifying Pixels](file:../../../../files/spring-2020/CISC-190/module-5/java_book_mediaComp_ch-6.pdf)

### 6.1 Conditional Pixel Changes

One way to conditionally execute code in Java is with an `if (expression)`
statement. The `if` is a keyword that means that if the expression in the
parentheses evaluates to `true` then execute the following statement or block of
statements. If false, then just skip the execution of that statement or block of
statements.

#### 6.1.1 Comparing Colors

What does it mean to compare two colors? How can the computer tell if the color
at the current pixel is "red"? The distance between two colors is the Cartesian
distance between the colors as points in a three-dimensional space, where red,
green, and blue are the three dimensions. Recall that the distance between two
points $(x_{1},\, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},\, y_{2})$ is:

$$
\sqrt{(x_{1} - x_{2})^{2} + (y_{1} - y_{2})^{2}}
$$

The similar measure for two colors $(red_{1},\, green_{1},\, blue_{1})$ and
$red_{2},\, green_{2},\, blue_{2})$ is:

$$
\sqrt{(red_{1} - red_{2})^{2} + (green_{1} - green_{2})^{2} + (blue_{1} -
blue_{2})^{2}}
$$

However, you won't have to code this. The Pixel class has an object method
colorDistance(Color color) which returns the distance between the color in the
current Pixel object and the passed color. The hard part is determining what
"close enough" is for two colors.

#### 6.1.2 Replacing Colors

Here's a program that tries to replace brown color with red.

```java
/** Program 33: Color Replacement: Turn Brown into Red
 * Method to turn the brown in a picture
 * into red
 */
public void turnBrownIntoRed()
{
  Color brown = new Color(42, 25, 15);
  Pixel[] pixels = this.getPixels();
  Pixel pixel = null;

  // loop through the pixels
  for (int i = 0; i < pixels.length; i++)
  {
    // get the current pixel
    pixel = pixels[i];

    //check if in distance to brown and if so double red
    if (pixel.colorDistance(brown) < 50.0)
      pixel.setColor(new Color((int) (pixel.getRed() * 2.0),
                               pixel.getGreen(),
                               pixel.getBlue()));
  }
}
```

```java
/** Program 35: Color Replacement with Passing in the Range
 * Method to turn brown to red in a rectangular area
 * specified by startX, endX-1, startY, endY-1
 * @param startX the starting location to check in x
 * @param endX the last pixel check is one less than this in x
 * @param startY the starting location to check in y
 * @param endY the last pixel check is one less than this in y
 */
public void turnBrownToRedInRectangle(int startX, int endX,
                                      int startY, int endY,
                                      double distance)
{
  Color brown = new Color(42, 25, 15);
  Pixel pixel = null;

  // loop through the x values
  for (int x = startX; x < endX; x++)
  {
    for (int y = startY; y < endY; y++)
    {
      // get the current pixel
      pixel = this.getPixel(x, y);

      /* check if in distance to brown is less than
       * the passed distance and if so double the red
       */
      if (pixel.colorDistance(brown) < distance)
        pixel.setColor(new Color((int) (pixel.getRed() * 2.0),
                                  pixel.getGreen(),
                                  pixel.getBlue()));
    }
  }
```

### 6.2 Simple Edge Detection: Conditionals with Two Options

#### 6.2.1 Negation

  - `!` is the _logical not_ operator that _negates_ the condition.

```java
> !true
false
> !false
true
```

#### 6.2.2 Testing for Both Conditions

```java
> int x = 30;
> if (x < 20) System.out.println("Yes, the value is less than 20");
> if (x >= 20) System.out.println("No, not less than 20");
No, not less than 20
```

#### 6.2.3 Conditionals with Two Options

The way to do this is with `if (expression)` and `else`

```java
> int x = 30;
> if (x < 20) System.out.println("Yes the value is less than 20");
else System.out.println("No, this value is not less than 20");

No, this value is not less than 20
```

#### 6.2.4 Simple Edge Detection

  - `getAverage()` = returns the average value of the pixel's RGB components

```java
/** Program 37: Edge Detection
  * Method to do a simple edge detection by comparing the
  * absolute value of the difference between the color
  * intensities (average of the color values) between a
  * pixel and the pixel below it. If the absolute value
  * of the difference between the color intensities is
  * less than a passed amount the top pixel color
  * will be set to white. Otherwise it is set to black.
  * @param amount if the absolute value of the difference
  * in the color average is less than this
  * set the color to white, else black
  */
public void edgeDetection(double amount) {
  Pixel topPixel = null;
  Pixel bottomPixel = null;
  double topAverage = 0.0;
  double bottomAverage = 0.0;
  int endY = this.getHeight() - 1;

  /* loop through y values from 0 to height - 1
    * (since compare to below pixel) */
  for (int y = 0; y < endY; y++) {
    // loop through the x values from 0 to width
    for (int x = 0; x < this.getWidth(); x++) {
      // get the top and bottom pixels
      topPixel = this.getPixel(x, y);
      bottomPixel = this.getPixel(x, y + 1);

      // get the color averages for the two pixels
      topAverage = topPixel.getAverage();
      bottomAverage = bottomPixel.getAverage();

      /* check if the absolute value of the difference
        * is less than the amount */
      if (Math.abs(topAverage - bottomAverage) < amount) {
        topPixel.setColor(Color.WHITE);
      } else {
        topPixel.setColor(Color.BLACK);
      }
    }
  }
}
```
