Video Lecture Notes

**Slope-intercept form**. Where $m$ as the slope, and $b$ as the y-intercept
$$
y = mx + b
$$

## 3.2 Solve By Substitution

Video Lecture Notes

In getting the value of $x$ or $y$, when a number equals itself, it means it has
infinitely many solutions (VIDEO, 14:30). Conversely, when a number equals to a
different number, the system of equations has no solution (VIDEO, 15:25).

## 3.3 Solve By Elimination

Playlist 1 Video 2 Lecture Notes

  - Matrices can be added, subtracted, multiplied together, but cannot be
    divided.
  - Matrices can also be multiplied by a number, called a _scalar_.
  - In multiplying matrices together, you multiply the row of the first matrices
    entry by the column of the second matrices entry, then add the product
    together which becomes the value of the matrix product entry (VIDEO 1,
    1:58).
    * Multiplying matrices have to be of the same size.

**Determinant**

- Value that can be computed from the elements of a **square** matrix.
- It can help you find the inverse of a 2 by 2 square matrix.
