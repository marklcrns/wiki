# Chapter 2: Functions

## 2.1 Vocabulary and Notations

#### Video Lecture

[VIDEO: What are functions?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52tpYl2tTqk)

Video lecture notes:

**Function** - something that relates one set into another set:

  - Input set, also called as the **Domain**.
  - Output set, also called as the **Range**
  - Function notation: $f(x) = y$, where $x$ is the input and $y$ is the range.

**Set** - a collection of values.

  - a set can be a _finite_ or _infinite_.

> A function can only have **ONE** output for every input. Having an input
outputs to more than one solution is NOT considered a function.

**Vertical line test**

  - A graphing test to see if there's more than one output to every input ($y's$
    to every $x$ in an ordered pair) of a function.

#### Video Lecture 1

[VIDEO 1: Surjective and Injective functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNX8BUWR0g)

Video lecture notes:

**Surjective (onto)**

  - A function is _surjective_ if every member of a set of _range_ ($y$) maps to **at
    least one** _domain_ ($x$).

**Injective (one-to-one)**

  - A function is _injective_ if a member of a set of _range_ maps to only one
    _domain_.

## 2.2 Polynomial Functions

#### Video Lecture

[VIDEO: What are polynomials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffLLmV4mZwU)

**Terms**

  - Mathematical expressions that has a number and a variable(s) multiplied
    together.

**Coefficient**

  - A number without a variable

**Polynomials**

  - Combination of terms joined together by addition or subtraction.
    * _Monomial_: has only one term
    * _Binomial_: has two terms
    * _Trinomial_: has three terms

## 2.3 Rational Functions

  - A rational function is any function which can be specified by a rule written
    as $f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$, where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomial
    functions.

Example 1:

$$
f(x) = \frac{12}{x}, g(x) = \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 9}, h(x) = \frac{(x + 1)(x -
4)}{x(x - 2)(x + 3)}, k(x) = \frac{3x}{x^2 + 4}
$$

These are examples of rational functions. The domains are, respectively:

  - for $f$, $\big\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \neq 0\big\}$
  - for $g$, $\big\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \neq \pm 3\big\}$
  - for $h$, $\big\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \neq 0,2,-3\big\}$
  - for $k$, $\mathbb{R}$ (since the denominator polynomial is never 0)


## 2.4 Linear Functions

### Video Lecture

[VIDEO: Linear Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIMrHOBM4g)

Video lecture notes

**Linear function**

  - A _linear function_ is any function specified by a rule of the form $f: x
    \to mx + b$, where $m \neq  0$. if $m = 0$, the function is not considered
    to be a linear function.
  - The graph of a linear function is always a **straight line**.
  - Equation: $f(x) ax + b$, $y$ as the independent variable and $x$ as the
    dependent variable, and $b$ as the constant

**Slope**

$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{rise}{run}
$$

**Horizontal and vertical lines**

  - A _horizontal line_ (a line parallel to the x-axis) **has slope 0**, since any
    two points on the line have the same y coordinates.
    * Equation: $y = k$
  - A _vertical line_ (a line parallel to the y-axis) **has undefined slope**,
    since any two points on the line have the same x coordinates.
    * Equation: $x = h$

The equation of a line can be written in several forms:

<a name="slope-intercept-form-term">**Slope-intercept form**</a>

- $y = mx + b$


<a name="point-slope-form-term">**Point-slope form**</a>

- $y - y_0 = m(x - x_{1})$


<a name="standard-form-term">**Standard form**</a>

- $Ax + By = C$, where $A, B, C$ are integers with no common factors; $A$ and
  $B$ are not both zero.

**Parallel and Perpendicular Lines**

  - If two non-vertical lines are parallel, their slopes are equal. Conversely,
    if two lines have the same slope, they are parallel; two vertical lines are
    also parallel.

If a line is horizontal, any line perpendicular to it is vertical, and
conversely. If two nonvertical lines, with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$, are
perpendicular, the their slopes satisfy $m_1m_2 = -1$ or $m_2 = -1/m_1$

## 2.7 Logarithmic Functions

### Logarithm Basics

A logarithmic function, $f(x) = \log_{a}x, a > 0, a \neq 1$, is the inverse
function to an exponential function $F(x) = a^x$. Thus, if $y = \log_{a}x$, then
$x = a^y$. That is, the logarithm of $x$ to the base $a$ is the exponent to
which $a$ must be raised to obtain $x$. Conversely, if $x = a^y$, then $y =
\log_{a}x$. Therefore the relation between logarithmic and exponential functions
can be described as:

$$
\log_{a}a^x = x \text{ and } a^{\log_{a}x} = x
$$

Logarithmic expressions can be rewritten in terms of other bases by means of the
change-of-base formula:

$$
\log_{a}x = \frac{\log_{b}x}{\log_{b}a}
$$
