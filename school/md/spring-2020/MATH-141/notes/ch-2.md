# Chapter 2: Functions

## 2.1 Vocabulary and Notations

[VIDEO: What are functions?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52tpYl2tTqk)

Video lecture notes:

**Function** - something that relates one set into another set:

  - Input set, also called as the **Domain**.
  - Output set, also called as the **Range**
  - Function notation: $f(x) = y$, where $x$ is the input and $y$ is the range.

**Set** - a collection of values.

  - a set can be a _finite_ or _infinite_.

> A function can only have **ONE** output for every input. Having an input
outputs to more than one solution is NOT considered a function.

**Vertical line test**

  - A graphing test to see if there's more than one output to every input ($y's$
    to every $x$ in an ordered pair) of a function.

[VIDEO: Surjective and Injective functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNX8BUWR0g)

Video lecture notes:

**Surjective (onto)**

  - A function is _surjective_ if every member of a set of _range_ ($y$) maps to **at
    least one** _domain_ ($x$).

**Injective (one-to-one)**

  - A function is _injective_ if a member of a set of _range_ maps to only one
    _domain_.

## 2.2 Polynomial Functions

**Terms**

  - Mathematical expressions that has a number and a variable(s) multiplied
    together.

**Coefficient**

  - A number without a variable

**Polynomials**

  - Combination of terms joined together by addition or subtraction.
    * _Monomial_: has only one term
    * _Binomial_: has two terms
    * _Trinomial_: has three terms

## 2.4 Linear Functions

Video lecture notes

**Linear function**

  - Equation: $f(x) ax + b$, $y$ as the independent variable and $x$ as the
    dependent variable.
