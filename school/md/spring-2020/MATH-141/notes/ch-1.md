    * Chapter 1 pages 8 - 19

## 1.1 Sets and Axioms

### Sets of Numbers

  - The sets of numbers used in algebra are, in general, subsets of **_R_**, the
    set of **real numbers**.
    * **Natural numbers**
      - **_N_**: The counting numbers.
      - e.g., 1, 2, 3.
      - **NOTE:** Zero (0) is not a natural number.
    * **Integers**
      - **_Z_**: The counting numbers, together with their opposites and 0.
      - e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, -1, −2, −3
    * **Rational Numbers**
      - **_Q:_** The set of all numbers that can be written as quotients a/b, b
        ≠ 0, a and b integers
      - e.g., 3/17, −5/13
    * **Irrational Numbers**
      - **_H:_** All real numbers that are not rational numbers
      - e.g., π, 2 , 5 , −π/3

**Examples**

  - The number −5 is a member of the sets **_Z_**, **_Q_**, **_R_**.
  - The number 156.73 is a member of the sets **_Q_**, **_R_**.
  - The number 5π is a member of the sets **_H_**, **_R_**.

### Axioms

There are two fundamental operations, addition and multiplication, which
have the following properties (a, b, c arbitrary real numbers):

  * Commutative Laws :
    - a + b = b + a: order does not matter in addition.
    - ab = ba: order does not matter in multiplication.
  * Associative Laws:
    - a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c: grouping does not matter in repeated addition.
    - a(bc) = (ab)c: grouping does not matter in repeated multiplication.
  * Distributive Laws:
    - a(b + c) = ab + ac; also (a + b)c = ac + bc: multiplication is
      distributive over addition.

  * Zero Factor Laws:
    - For every real number a, a ⋅ 0 = 0.
    - If ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0.
  * Laws for Negatives:
    - − (− a) = a
    - (− a)(− b) = ab
    - − ab = (− a)b = a(− b) = − (− a)(− b) = − (ab)
    - (− 1)a = − a
  * Laws for Quotients:
    - \- a/b = -a/b = a/-b = \- -a/-b
    - -a/-b = a/b
    - a/b = c/d if and only if ad = bc.

### Solving Linear Equations Intro

[Video Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/embed/dDJT81TrCCw)

Linear equations contains equations that has one variable with a degree of 1

Samples of Linear Equations:

  * 3x = 11 _or_ 3x¹ = 11
  * 3x + 4x = 125 _or_ 3x¹ + 4x¹ = 125

### 4 Steps in Solving Linear Equations

#### Step 4: Kill the coefficient

- [🎬 VIDEO Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/embed/BSIXtFkNvzk)

**Example 1:**

Consider 3x = 125

This can be done by getting rid of the coefficient of x (3) by multiplying 1/3 on
both sides--_cancellation of multiplication_

Solution:

    3x = 125
    1/3(3x) = 1/3(125)

    x = 125/3

**Example 2:**

Consider 5x = 30 + π

Solution:

    5x = 30 + π

    x = (30 + π)/5

#### Step 3: Collect x's

- [🎬 VIDEO Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/embed/e6w0VbPYXKg)

**Example 1:**

Consider 3x + 4x = 125

Solution:

    3x + 4x = 125
    (3 + 4)x = 125     Distribute the x

    x =  125           Kill the coefficient
        -----
        3 + 4

**Example 2:**

Consider 7x + 5x = 125 + √8

Solution:

    7x + 5x = 125 + √8
    (7 + 5)x = 125 + √8

    x = 125 + √8
        --------
         7 + 5

**Example 3:**

Consider 5x + πx = 30 + 2/5

Solution:

    5x + πx = 30 + 2/5
    (5x + π)x = 30 + 2/5

    x = 30 + 2/5
        --------
         5 + π

**Example 4:**

Consider 5x + √7x = 30 + π

Solution:

    5x + √7x = 30 + π
    (5x + √7)x = 30 + π

    x = 30 + π
        ------
        5 + √7

**Example 5:**

Consider

          √3x   4
    5πx + --- = - + π
           9    7

Solution:

          √3x   4
    5πx + --- = - + π
           9    7
    (5π + √3/9)x = 4/7 + π

    x =  4/7 + π
        ---------
        5π + √3/9

#### Step 2: Move x's

- [🎬 VIDEO Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/embed/001YOoma3B0)

We CAN'T gather the x's if they are NOT all on one side

**Example 1:**

Consider 3x - 4 = 12x + 11

Solution:

    3x - 4 = 12x + 11
    3x + -4 = 12x + 11            (Optional) Convert subtraction to addition to
                                  makes it easier
    3x + -4 + 4 = 12x + 11 + 4    Kill the coefficient by adding 4 to both sides
    3x = 12x + 15
    3x + -12x = 12x + 15 - 12x    Move the 12x by subtracting it to both sides.
                                  Cancellation law of addition
    3x + -12x = 15
    (3 + -12)x = 15               Distributive law

    x =   15
        -------
        3 - 12

**Example 2:**

Consider 3x - 1/2 = 13 - 11x

Solution 1:

    3x - 1/2 = 13 - 11x
    3x + -1/2 + 1/2 = 13 - 11x + 1/2    Subtraction to addition for convenience.
                                        Then, add 1/2 to both sides to kill it
    3x = 13 + -11x + 1/2
    3x + 11x = 13 + -11x + 1/2 = 11x    Move 11x to the other side by
                                        cancellation law of addition
    3x + 11x = 13 + 1/2
    (3 + 11)x = 13 + 1/2                Distributive law

    x = 13 + 1/2                        Kill the coefficient and done
        --------
         3 + 11

Solution 2:

    3x - 1/2 = 13 - 11x
    2(3x + -1/2) = (13 - 11x)2    Subtraction to addition for convenience. Then,
                                  multiply both sides by 2 to kill to get rid of
                                  the fraction
    6x + -1 = 26 + -22x

    6x + 22x = 26 + 1             For shortcuts, just move the numbers on either
                                  sides by just changing the signs
    (6 + 22)x = 27                Distributive law

    x =   27                      Kill the coefficient and done
        ------
        6 + 22

**Example 3:**

Consider 3/5x - 1/2 = 3/10 + 7x

Solution:

    3/5x - 1/2 = 3/10 + 7x
    3/5x + -1/2 + 1/2 = 3/10 + 7x + 1/2    Get rid of 1/2 by adding to both
                                           sides
    3/5x = 3/10 + 7x + 1/2
    3/5x + -7x = 3/10 + 7x + 1/2 + -7x     Move 7x by cancellation law of
                                           addition
    3/5x + -7x  = 3/10 + 1/2
    (3/5 + -7)x = 3/10 + 1/2               Gather the x's

    x = 3/10 + 1/2
        ----------
         3/5 - 7

#### Step 1: Free x's

- [🎬 VIDEO Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/embed/sA9W32Wx5Hw)

We CAN'T MOVE the x's if they are trapped inside ()'s or fractions

**Example 1:**

Consider 3(x + 1) = 2(x - 5)

Solution:

    Step 1:
    3(x + 1) = 2(x - 5)
    3x + 3 = 2x + -10       Distributive property. Free the x's out of ()'s

    Step 2
    3x + -2x = -10 + -3     Move 2x to the other side to gather all x's

    Step 3
    (3 + -2)x = -10 + -3    Gather the x's

    Step 4
    x = -10 - 3            Kill the coefficient
        --------
         3 - 2

**Example 2:**

Consider

              x + 4        11x + 1
    3(x +1) - ----- = 13 - -------
                2             3

Solution:

              x + 4        11x + 1
    3(x +1) - ----- = 13 - -------
                2             3
    3x + 3 + -(x/2 + 4/2) = 13 + -(11x/3 + 1/3)    Convert to addition and apply
                                                   distributive property
    3x + 3 + -x/2 + -4/2 = 1 + -11/3x + -1/3
    3x + -x/2 + 11/3x = 13 + -1/3 - 3 + 4/2        Move all variables to one
                                                   side and coefficients to the
                                                   other
    (3 - 1/2 + 11/3)x = 13 + -1/3 -3 + 4/2         Gather the x's

    x = 13 - 1/3 - 3 + 4/2
        ------------------
          3 - 1/2 + 11/3

**Quadratic Formula**

$$

$$

> Note: Getting the **square root** of a **negative** number is an imaginary
number

### Descartes' Rule of Signs

Descartes' Rule of Signs can be used to determine the number of positive real
zeros, negative real zeros, and imaginary zeros in a **polynomial function**.

**Positive real zeros**

The number of **positive** real zeros in y = P(x) is equal to the number of
changes if sign in front of each term, **or is less than this by an even
number**.

    P(x) 9x⁵ - 4x⁴ - 2x³ - x² + 5x - 7
          +     -     -    -    +    -

This has **3** change of signs, from 9x⁵ to 4x⁴, x² to 5x, and 5x to 7.  Also,
_the number less than this (3) by an even number_ (which is 2) suggest that the
other number is 1. Therefore there are 3 (or 1) positive real zeros.

**Negative real zeros**

The number of **negative** real zeros in y = P(x) is the same as the number of
changes of sign in front of each terms of P(-x), **or is less than this value by
an even number**.

    P(x) 9x⁵ - 4x⁴ - 2x³ - x² + 5x - 7

    Rewrite this as

    P(x) 9(-x)⁵ - 4(-x)⁴ - 2(-x)³ - (-x)² + 5(-x) - 7

    P(-x) -9x⁵ - 4x⁴ + 2x³ - x² - 5x - 7
            -     -     +    -    -    -

This has **2** sign changes, from 4x⁴ to 2x³ and 2x³ to x². Also, _the number
less than this (2) value by an even number_ (which is 0) suggests the number 0.
Therefore there are 2 (or 0) negative real zeros.

| Positive Real Zeros | Negative Real Zeros | Number of Imaginary Zeros |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| 3                   | 2                   | 5 - 3 - 2 = 0             |
| 1                   | 0                   | 5 - 1 - 0 = 4             |
| 3                   | 0                   | 5 - 3 - 0 = 2             |
| 1                   | 2                   | 5 - 1 - 2 = 2             |

**The 5 in the imaginary number is the highest exponent in the equation**

  - The null set $\emptyset$, also called the **empty set**, can be used to
    represent the answer of an equation with **no solution**.

**Extraneous Solutions**

  - Results that cannot be verified in the original equation even if you solve
    the problem correctly
  - Because a 0 in a denominator would make it undefined
  - One example is having values of x that would result to a zero (0) e.g., 1/2x
    where x = 0 will result to undefined.

### Equations and Inequalities

- [⬇ Pre-calc Textbook Reference 1](file:../../../../files/spring-2020/MATH-141/pre-calc_textbookRef.pdf)
    * Chapter 2: Equations and Inequalities

**Linear Equations**

  - $ax + b = 0$
    * if $a \neq 0$, a linear equation has exactly one solution.
    * if $a = 0$, the equation has no solutions unless $b = 0$.

**Quadratic Equations**

Standard form

  - $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$, where $(a \neq 0)$

**Four methods for solving quadratic equations.**

1. **Factoring**. If the polynomial $ax^{2} + bx + c$ has linear factors with
   rational coefficients, write it in factored form, then apply the zero-factor
   property that $AB = 0$ only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. **Square Root Property**. If the equation is in the form $A^{2} = b$, where
   $b$ is a constant, then its solutions are found as $A = \sqrt{b}$ and $A =
   −\sqrt{b}$ , generally written $A = \pm\sqrt{b}$.
3. **Completing the Square**.
  - Write the equation in the form $x^{2} + px = q$.
  - Add $p^{2} /4$ to both sides to form $x^{2}+ px + p^{2}/4 = q + p^{2}/4$.
  - The left side is now a perfect square. Write $(x + p/2)^{2} = q + p^{2}/4$ and
    apply the square root property.
- [🎬 Youtube: Completing the Square Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prx_Bf2hakw)
4. **Quadratic Formula**. The solutions of $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$, $(a ≠ 0)$ can always
   be written as:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

In general, a quadratic equation is
solved by first checking whether it is easily factorable. If it is, then the
factoring method is used; otherwise the quadratic formula is used.

In the quadratic formula, the quantity $b^{2} − 4ac$ is called the
_discriminant_.  The sign of this quantity determines the number and type of
solutions of a quadratic equation

| Sign of discriminant | Number and type of solutions |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| positive             | 2 real solutions             |
| zero                 | 1 repeated real solution     |
| negative             | 2 imaginary solutions        |

### Radical Equations

Equations containing radicals require an additional operation: In general, the
equation $a = b$ is not equivalent to the equation $a^{n} = b^{n}$ ; however,
if $n$ is odd, they have the same real solutions. If $n$ is even, all solutions
of $a = b$ are found among the solutions of $a^{n} = b^{n}$ . Hence it is
permissible to raise both sides to an even power if all solutions of the
resulting equation are checked to see if they are solutions of the original
equation.
