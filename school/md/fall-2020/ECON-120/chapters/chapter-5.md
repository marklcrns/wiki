# Chapter 5: Measuring a Nation's Production and Income

<a name="macroeconomics-term">**Macroeconomics**</a>

- The study of the nation's economy as a whole; focuses on the issues of
  inflation, unemployment and economic growth.


<a name="inflation-term">**Inflation**</a>

- Sustained increase in the average prices of all goods and services.


## 5.1 The Flip Sides of Macroeconomic Activity: Production and Income

Before we can study growth and fluctuations, we need to have a basic vocabulary
and understanding of some key concepts. We begin with the terms production and
income because these are the flip sides of the macroeconomic coin, so to speak.
Every day, men and women go off to work, where they produce or sell merchandise
or provide services. At the end of the week or month, they return home with
their paychecks or income. They spend some of that money on other products and
services, which are produced by other people. **In other words, production leads
to income, and income leads to production**.

From a big picture perspective, we look at certain measures that will tell us
how much the economy is producing and how well it is growing. We will also be
able to measure the total income generated in the economy and how this income
flows back to workers and investors. These two measures--a country's production
and income--are critical to a nation's economic health. Macroeconomists collect
and analyze production and income data to understand how many people will find
jobs and whether their living standards are rising or falling. Government
officials use the data and analysis to develop economic policies.

### The Circular Flow of Production and Income

Let's begin with a simple diagram known as the _circular flow_, shown in Figure
5.1. We start with a very simple economy that does not have a government or a
foreign sector. Households and firms make transactions in two markets known as
_factor markets_ and _product markets_. In factor, or input, markets, households
supply labor to firms. Households are also the ultimate owners of firms, as well
as of all the resources firms use in their production, which we call _capital_.
Consequently, we can think of households as providing capital to firms--land,
buildings, and equipment--to produce output. Product, or output, markets are
markets in which firms sell goods and services to consumers.

![Figure 5.1 The Circulatr Flow of Production and Income](../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-5/figure-5.1.png)

The point of the circular flow diagram is simple and fundamental: Production
generates income. In factor markets, when households supply labor and capital to
firms, they are compensated by the firms. They earn wages for their work, and
they earn interest, dividends, and rents on the capital they supply to the
firms. The households then use their income to purchase goods and services in
the product markets. The firm uses the revenues it receives from the sale of its
products to pay for the factors of production (land, labor, and capital).

## 5.2 The Production Approach: Measuring a Nation's Macroeconomic Activity Using Gross Domestic Product

<a name="gross-domestic-product-term">**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**</a>

- The total market value of final goods and services produced within an economy
  in a given year.
- GDP is also the most common measure of an economy's total output.

All the owrds in the GDP definition are important, so let's analyze them

_Total market_ value means we take the quantity of goods produced, multiply them
by their respective prices, and then add up the totals. If an economy produced
two cars at $25,000 per car and three computers at $2,000 per computer, the
total value of these goods will be

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 \text{ cars } \times \$25,000 \text{ per car }          & = \$50,000 \\
3 \text{ computers } \times \$2,000 \text{ per computer } & = \$\:\:6,000 \\
                                                          & = \$56,000
\end{aligned}
$$

Final goods and services in the GDP definition means those goods and services
that are sold to ultimate, or final, purchasers. For example, the two cars that
were produced would be final goods if they were sold to households or to a
business. However, to produce the cars the automobile manufacturer bought steel
that went into the body of the cars, and we do not count this steel as a final
good or service in GDP. Steel is an example of an intermediate good, one that is
used in the production process. An **intermediate good** is not considered a
final good or service.

<a name="intermediate-good-term">**Intermediate good**</a>

- Goods used in the production process that are not final goods and services.

The reason we do not count intermediate goods as final goods is to avoid
double-counting. The price of the car already reflects the price of the steel
contained in it. We do not want to count the steel twice.

The final words in our GDP definition are in _a given year_. GDP is expressed as
a rate of production--that is, as "X" amount of dollars per year. In 2014, for
example, GDP in the United States was $17,420 billion. Goods produced in prior
years, such as cars or houses, are not included in GDP for a given year, even if
one consumer sells a house or car to another in that year. Only newly produced
products are included in GDP.

Because we measure GDP using the current prices for goods and services, GDP will
increase if prices increase, even if the physical amount of goods that are
produced remains the same. Suppose that next year the economy again produces two
cars and three computers, but all the prices in the economy double: The price of
cars is $50,000, and the price of computers is $4,000. GDP will also be twice as
high, or $112,000, even though the quantity produced is the same as during the
prior year:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 \text{ cars } \times \$50,000 \text{ per car } &= \$100,000  \\
+ \\
3 \text{ computers } \times \$4,000 \text{ per computer } &= \$\:\:12,000  \\
 &= \$112,000
\end{aligned}
$$

But to say that GDP has doubled would be misleading because exactly the same
goods were produced. To avoid this problem, let's apply the real-nominal
principle, one of our five basic principles of economics.

<a name="real-nominal-principle-term">**Real-nominal principle**</a>

- What matters to people is the real value of money or income--its purchasing
  power-- not the face value of money or income.

What we need is another measure of total output that doesn't increase just
because prices increase. For this reason, economists have developed the concept
of **real GDP**, a measure that controls for changes in prices. Later in this
chapter, we explain how real GDP is calculated. The basic idea is simple. When
we use current prices to measure GDP, we are using **nominal GDP**. Nominal GDP
can increase for one of two reasons: Either the production of goods and services
has increased, or the prices of those goods and services have increased.

<a name="real-gdp-term">**Real GDP**</a> - A measure of GDP that controls for
changes in price.<br>
<a name="nominal-gdp-term">**Nominal GDP**</a> - The value of GDP in current
dollars.<br>

To explain the concept of real GDP, we first need to look at a simple example.
Suppose an economy produces a single good: computers. In year 1, 10 computers
were produced, and each sold for $2,000. In year 2, 12 computers were produced,
and each sold for $2,100. Nominal GDP is $20,000 in year 1 and $25,200 in year
2; it has increased by a factor of 1.26 or 26 percent. However, we can also
measure real GDP by using year 1 prices as a measure of what was produced in
year 1 and what was produced in year 2.

In year 1, real GDP is

$$
10 \text{ computers } \times \$2,000 \text{ per computer } = \$20,000
$$

In year 2, real GDP (in year 1 terms) is

$$
12 \text{ computers } \times \$2,000 \text{ per computer } = \$24,000
$$

Real GDP in year 2 is still greater than real GDP in year 1, now by a factor of
1.2, or 20 percent. The key idea is that we construct a measure using the same
prices for both years and thereby take price changes into account.

Figure 5.2 plots real GDP for the U.S. economy for the years 1947 through 2013.
The graph shows that real GDP has grown substantially over this period. This is
what economists call **economic growth**--sustained increases in the real GDP of
an economy over a long period of time.

### 5.2.1 The Components of GDP


Economists divide GDP into four broad categories, each corresponding to
different types of purchases represented in GDP:

1. Consumption expenditures: purchases by consumers
2. Private investment expenditures: purchases by firms
3. Government purchases: purchases by federal, state, and local governments
4. Net exports: net purchases by the foreign sector (domestic exports minus
   domestic imports)

#### Consumption Expenditures

<a name="consumption-expenditures-term">**Consumption expenditures**</a>

- Purchases of newly produced goods and services by households.
- These purchases include flat-screen TVs, smartphones, automobiles, clothing,
  hairstyling services, jewelry, movie or basketball tickets, food, and all
  other consumer items.

We can break down consumption into durable goods, nondurable goods, and
services. _Durable goods_, such as automobiles or refrigerators, last for a long
time. _Nondurable goods_, such as food, last for a short time. _Services_ are
work in which people play a prominent role in delivery (such as a dentist
filling a cavity). They range from manicures to health care and are the
fastest-growing component of consumption in the United States. Overall,
consumption spending is the most important component of GDP, constituting about
69 percent of total purchases.

#### Private Investment Expenditures

<a name="private-investment-expenditures-term">**Private investment expenditures**</a>

- Purchases of newly produced goods and services by firms

Consist of three components:

1. First, there is spending on new plants and equipment during the year. If a
   firm builds a new factory or purchases a new machine, the new factory or new
   machine is included in the year's GDP. Purchasing an existing building or
   buying a used machine does not count in GDP, because the goods were not
   produced during the current year.
2. Second, newly produced housing is included in investment spending. The sale
   of an existing home to a new owner is not counted because the house was not
   built in the current year.
3. Finally, if firms add to their stock of inventories, the increase in
   inventories during the current year is included in GDP. If a hardware store
   had \$1,000 worth of nuts and bolts on its shelves at the beginning of the
   year and \$1,100 at the year's end, its inventory investment is \$100
   $(\$1,000 - \$,1000)\$. This \$100 increase in inventory investment is
   included in GDP.

We call the total of new investment expenditures **gross investment**. During
the year, some of the existing plant, equipment, and housing will deteriorate or
wear out. This wear and tear is called **depreciation**, or sometimes a capital
consumption allowance. If we subtract depreciation from gross investment, we
obtain **net investment**.

<a name="gross-investment-term">**Gross investment**</a> - Total new investment
expenditures.<br>
<a name="depreciation-term">**Depreciation**</a> - Reduction in the value of
capital goods over a 1-year period due to physical wear and tear and to
obsolescence; also called _capital consumption allowance_.<br>
<a name="net-investment-term">**Net investment**</a> - Gross investment minus
depreciation.<br>

#### Government Purchases

<a name="government-purchases-term">**Government purchases**</a>

- Purchases of newly produced goods and services by local, state, and federal
  governments.
- This category does not include all spending by governments. It excludes
  **transfer payments**.

<a name="transfer-payments-term">**Transfer payments**</a>

- Payments from governments to individuals that do not correspond to the
  production of goods and services.
- For example, payments for Social Security, welfare, and interest on government
  debt are all considered transfer payments and thus are not included in
  government purchases in GDP. Nothing is being produced by the recipients in
  return for money being paid, or "transferred," to them. But wage payments to
  the police, postal workers, and the staff of the Internal Revenue Service are
  all included because they do correspond to services these workers are
  currently producing.

Because transfer payments are excluded from GDP, a vast portion of the budget
of the federal government is not part of GDP.

#### Net Exports

To understand the role of the foreign sector, we first need to define three
terms. **Imports** are goods and services we buy from other countries.
**Exports** are goods and services made here and sold to other countries. **Net
exports** are total exports minus total imports.

<a name="imports-term">**Imports**</a> - A good or service produced in a foreign
country and purchased by residents of the home countery (e.g., the United
States).<br>
<a name="export-term">**Export**</a> - A good or service produced in the home
counter (e.g., the United States) and sold in another country.<br>
<a name="net-exports-term">**Net exports**</a> - Exports minus imports.<br>

Consumption, investment, and government purchases include all purchases by
consumers, firms, and the government, whether or not the goods were produced in
the United States. However, **GDP is supposed to measure the goods produced in
the United States. Consequently, we subtract purchases of foreign goods by
consumers, firms, or the government when we calculate GDP because these goods
were not produced in the United States. At the same time, we add to GDP any
goods produced here and sold abroad**, for example, airplanes made in the United
States and sold in Europe. By including net exports as a component of GDP, we
correctly measure U.S. production by adding exports and subtracting imports.

When we buy more goods from abroad than we sell, we have a **trade deficit**. A
trade surplus occurs when our exports exceed our imports. Figure 5.3 shows the
U.S. **trade surplus** as a share of GDP from 1960 to 2017. Although at times
the United States has had a small trade surplus, it has generally run a trade
deficit. In recent years, the trade deficit has increased and has fluctuated
between 2 and 6 percent of GDP.

<a name="trade-deficit-term">**Trade deficit**</a> - the excess of imports over
exports<br>
<a name="trade-surplus-term">**Trade surplus**</a> - The excess of exports over
imports<br>

![Figure 5.3 U.S. Trade Balance as a Share of GDP, 1960-2017](../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-5/figure-5.3.png)

### 5.2.2 Putting It All Together: The GDP Equation

We can summarize our discussion of who purchases GDP with a simple equation that
combines the four components of GDP:

$$
Y = C + I + G + NX
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y  &= \text{GDP} \\
C  &= \text{Consumption} \\
I  &= \text{Investment} \\
G  &= \text{Government purchases} \\
NX &= \text{Net exports}
\end{aligned}
$$

## 5.3 The Income Approach: Measuring a Nation’s Macroeconomic Activity Using National Income

Recall from the circular flow that one person's production ends up being another
person's income. Income is the flip side of our macroeconomic coin. As a result,
in addition to measuring a nation's activity by measuring production, we can
also gauge it by measuring a nation's income. The total income earned by U.S.
residents working in the United States and abroad is called **national income**.

<a name="national-income-term">**National income**</a>

- The total income earned by a nation's residents both domestically and abroad
  in the production of goods and services.
