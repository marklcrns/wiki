# Chapter 5

Sales versus Value Added. In comparing a small country's GDP to a major
corporation, why is it best to use the value added of the corporation rather
than its total sales?

- Corporations typically buy goods such as inputs from many other companies to
  produce sales.

When we calculate GDP for a country, do we use the total sales of all goods and
services?

- No. GDP only includes the sale of final goods and services produced within a
  given year.

Calculating Real GDP, Price Indices, and Inflation. Using the data from the
table below, answer the following questions:

<center>

|      | Quantities Produced |                | Prices       |                         |
|------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|-------------------------|
|      | CDs                 | Tennis Rackets | Price per CD | Price per Tennis Racket |
| 2011 | 105                 | 210            | \$22         | \$110                   |
| 2012 | 120                 | 225            | \$24         | \$125                   |

</center>

- Real GDP in 2011 using 2011 prices is $**24,510**
- Real GDP in 2012 using 2011 prices is $**27,390**

> Real GDP in 2012 using 2011 prices is the quantity of CDs produced in 2012
> times the 2011 price of CDs plus the quantity of tennis rackets produced in
> 2012 times the 2011 price of tennis rackets.

- Real GDP grew by **7.79** percent.

$$
\frac{27390 - 25410}{25410} \times 100  = 7.79 \text{ percent }
$$

- The price index for GDP (GDP Deflator) for 2012 using 2011 as the base year is
  **113.20**

> GDP Deflator = $\frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}} \times 100$

$$
\frac{(120 \cdot 24) + (225 \cdot 125)}{(120 \cdot 22) + (225 \cdot 110)} \times 100 = 113.20
$$

- Prices increased by **13.2** percent

$$
\frac{113.20 - 100}{100} = 0.132 = 13.2 \text{ percent }
$$

Using a New Base Year to Calculate Real GDP and Inflation. Using the data from
the table below, answer the following questions using 2012 prices.

<center>

|      | Quantities Produced |                | Prices       |                         |
|------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|-------------------------|
|      | CDs                 | Tennis Rackets | Price per CD | Price per Tennis Racket |
| 2011 | 105                 | 200            | \$21         | \$105                   |
| 2012 | 130                 | 230            | \$24         | \$130                   |

</center>

- Real GDP in 2011 using 2012 prices is $**28,520**

> Real GDP in 2011 using 2012 prices is the quantity of CDs produced in 2011
> times the 2012 price of CDs plus the quantity of tennis rackets produced in
> 2011 times the 2012 price of tennis rackets.

- Real GDP in 2012 using 2012 prices is $**33,020**

> Real GDP in 2012 using 2012 prices is the quantity of CDs produced in 2012
> times the 2012 price of CDs plus the quantity of tennis rackets produced in
> 2012 times the 2012 price of tennis rackets.

- Real GDP grew by **15.78** percent

$$
\frac{33020 - 28520}{28520} \times 100 = 15.78 \text{ percent }
$$

- The price index for GDP for 2012 using 2012 as the base year is **100**

> GDP Deflator = $\frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}} \times 100$

$$
\frac{(120 \cdot 24) + (225 \cdot 125)}{(120 \cdot 24) + (225 \cdot 125)} \times 100 = 100
$$

- Prices increased by **22.84** percent.

$$
\frac{(130 \cdot 24) + (230 \cdot 130)}{(130 \cdot 21) + (230 \cdot 105)} \times 100 = 122.84
~\\
~\\
\frac{122.84 - 100}{100} \times 100 = 22.84 \text{ percent }
$$

> To get the price change, calculate the difference in the GDP deflator between
> 2011 and 2012 and divide by the GDP deflator in 2011.

1. Does Spending Measure Welfare? Suppose a community spends \$1 million on
   salaries and equipment for its police department. Because it believes that
   citizens are now more law abiding, the community decides to cut back on the
   number of police it employs. As a result, the community now spends \$800,000
   less on the police officers. The crime rate remains the same.

   a. What happens to measured GDP?

- GDP falls by \$800,000

   b. Does this change in GDP accurately reflect welfare in this case?

- Yes, because the savings on police officers can now be spent on welfare.


2. Buying a Foreign Car. Buying a foreign car made abroad for \$50,000

- increases consumption by \$50,000, increases imports by \$50,000, leaves
  exports unchanged, decreases net exports by \$50,000, but does not change GDP.


3. A recession occurs if real GDP falls for ____ consecutive quarters.

- 2


4. Australian GNP and GDP. Australia contains many natural resources and foreign
   firms often come into Australia to extract them. The profits that those
   foreign firms make are sent back to their home countries.

   GDP in Australia is

- larger than GNP in Australia because the profits that are earned by foreign
  firms are sent back to their home country.


5. In **factor** markets, households supply labor and capital to firms and they
   are compensated by the firms. The households use their **income** to purchase
   goods and services in the **product** markets. The firm uses the **revenues**
   it receives from the sale of its products to pay for the factors of
   production (land, labor, and capital) in the **factor** market.
