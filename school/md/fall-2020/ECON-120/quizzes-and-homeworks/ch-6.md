Calculating Data for the U.S. Economy. Here are some data for the U.S. economy
on April 01, 2020:

    There were 230.1 million individuals 16 years of age and older.
    There were 133.4 million individuals employed.
    There were 23.1 million individuals unemployed.

*Real-time data provided by Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal
Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.

Using the information given above for the U.S. economy, on April 01, 2020 , the
labor force was **156.5** million.

Using the information given above for the U.S. economy, on April 01, 2020 , the
labor force participation rate was **68** percent.

Using the information given above for the U.S. economy, on April 01, 2020 ,
the unemployment rate was **14.8** percent.

Alternative Unemployment Measures. An economy has 120,000,000 people employed,
7, 000, 000 unemployed, and 5, 000, 000 discouraged workers. The conventional
measure of the unemployment rate is **5.51** percent.

The best alternative measure that takes into account discouraged workers is an
unemployment rate of **9.09** percent.

The following table gives the value of selected consumer price index categories
from FRED* for August, 2017 and August, 2020.

**Consumer Price Indexes: Selected Categories**

<center>

| Month/Yr | Food and Beverages | Apparel | Transportation | Medical Care |
|----------|--------------------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Aug/2017 | 250.304            | 125.417 | 200.197        | 476.998      |
| Aug/2020 | 268.474            | 117.450 | 201.535        | 523.601      |

*Real-time data provided by Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal
Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.

As with all index numbers, the overall CPI and its several categories assign to
the arbitrarily selected base year (or period) the numerical value **100**.

Using the data recorded above, complete the following table by computing, for
each category, the percentage change in prices over the three-year period from
Aug/2017 to Aug/2020.

**Three-Year Price Inflation: Selected Categories**

<center>

| Category: | Food and Beverages | Apparel    | Transportation | Medical Care |
|-----------|--------------------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| Inflation | **7.26%**          | **-6.35%** | **0.67%**      | **9.77%**    |

</center>

According to the calculations shown in the preceding table, the three-year
period produced the least amount of inflation in

- Apparel

Real-Time Data Analysis Exercise The following table contains data from FRED* on
the consumer price index and the nominal average hourly wage for production and
nonsupervisory employees in the private sector for August of 2010 and 2020.

<center>

| Month/Yr | Average Hourly Nominal Wage | Consumer Price Index |
|----------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Aug/2010 | \$19.11                     | 218.3                |
| Aug/2020 | \$24.78                     | 259.9                |

</center>

*Real-time data provided by Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal
Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.

When the nominal wage increases, workers know that their buying power (over
goods and services) is unambiguously higher. This claim is **false**.

Using the data recorded in the preceding table, complete the following table by
computing the value of the real average hourly wage (for private production and
nonsupervisory employees).

| Month/Yr | Average Hourly Real Wage |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Aug/2010 | **\$8.75**               |
| Aug/2020 | **\$9.53**               |

> To calculate the real average hourly wage for each time period, divide the
nominal average hourly wage by the CPI and multiply by 100.

Over the ten -year interval under examination, the average hourly nominal wage
changed by 29.7% and the real average hourly wage changed by **8.9**%.

The change in the real average hourly wage indicates that individuals have,
since August of 2010 , experienced an **increase** in their standard of living.


## Quiz

1. Taxes on Stock Gains and Inflation. Suppose you bought a stock for \$100 and
   its value stayed constant in real terms. Over 20 years, the price of the
   stock in dollar terms has doubled.

   If you sold the stock after 20 years and your tax rate was 15.0%, how much
   tax would you owe? \$**15**.

   The real tax burden on buying and then selling stocks tends to

- increase with inflation because the nominal gain, on which the tax burden is
  based, increases with inflation; but inflation reduces the real gain.


2. If unemployed individuals left the labor force because they no longer
   believed they could get jobs, the measured unemployment rate will **fall**.


3. The table to the right shows unemployment rates for 2017 for certain
   developed countries. These countries all have modern, industrial economies,
   and their unemployment rates differ significantly.

   **Italy** had the second highest rate of unemployment while the **United States** had the second lowest.

   The sharp differences in unemployment rates reflect a number of factors,
   including how much government support is provided to unemployed workers. In
   countries in which support is the more generous, there is **less** incentive
   to work and unemployment will tend to be **higher**.


4. Expenditures by Older Adults. The elderly might consume a different basket of
   goods than the average for the U.S. population because their

- needs and wants are different because they are at a different stage of life.

   When considering expenditures categories, the elderly might have more
   expenditures in

- housing and medical care and less in transportation, education, and food.


5. Calculating Data for the U.S. Economy. Here are some data for the U.S.
   economy in January 2017:

        256.78 million individuals 16 years of age and older.
        154.43 million employed.
        6.68 million unemployed.

    - In the U.S. economy, the labor force is **161.11** million.
    - The labor force participation rate is **62.74** percent.
    - The unemployment rate is **4.15** percent.
