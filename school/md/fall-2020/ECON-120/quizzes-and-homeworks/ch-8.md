## Homework

According to the Solow model, capital deepening, an increase in the stock of
capital per worker, will occur as long as total saving **exceeds** depreciation.
A **higher** saving rate will promote capital deepening. Technological progress
**raises** output, and allows capital deepening to **continue**.

    The basic points of the Solow model are:

    1. Capital deepening, an increase in the stock of capital per worker, will occur
      as long as total saving exceeds depreciation. As capital deepening occurs,
      there will be economic growth and increased real wages.
    2. Eventually, the process of capital deepening will come to a halt as
      depreciation catches up with total saving.
    3. A higher saving rate will promote capital deepening. If a country saves more,
      it will have a higher output. But eventually, the process of economic growth
      through capital deepening alone comes to an end, even though this may take
      decades to occur.
    4. Technological progress not only directly raises output, but also it allows
      capital deepening to continue.

The economy grows 3.54 percent per year over a 20 year period. 0.92 percent per
year is attributed to labor and 1.39 percent per year is attributed to capital.
Therefore, **1.23** percent per year must be due to technological progress.

> $3.54 - (0.92 + 1.39)$

Germany and Japan after World War II. Much of the stock of capital in the economies of Japan and Germany was destroyed during World War II. 


1. Use the point drawing tool  to plot and label a point on the graph that
   indicates the position of Japan or Germany (label this J or G)
2. Use the point drawing tool to plot and label a point that indicates the
   position of the U.S.  immediately after World War II.

**Growth in Japan and Germany after the war was higher than that in the United
States because**

- **Japan and Germany increased the capital stock at a higher rate than the United
  States.**


## Quiz

1. Technological Progress in Banking. Computers have revolutionized banking for
   consumers through the growth of ATMs and electronic bill paying capabilities.

- is defined by economists as an increase in output with no additional increases
  in inputs.


2. Education can contribute to economic growth by

- complementing physical capital and developing new ideas.


3. If everything else is held equal, an increase in the size of the population
   will **increase** total output and **decrease** per capita output.


4. Future Generations. Some economists say that economic growth involves a
   trade-off between current generations and future generations. If a current
   generation raises its saving rate, what does it sacrifice?

- Current consumption

   What will be gained for future generations?

- Both a and b. (A. More output, B. More capital)


5. Germany and Japan after World War II. Much of the stock of capital in the
   economies of Japan and Germany was destroyed during World War II.

   Holding the labor force constant, output from Japan and Germany immediately
   after World War II would have been **lower than** output in the United
   States.

   Growth in Japan and Germany after World War II was higher than that in the
   United States because

- Japan and Germany increased their capital stock at a higher rate than the
  United States
