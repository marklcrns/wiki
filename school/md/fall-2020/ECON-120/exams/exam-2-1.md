# Exam 2 Attempt 1

> Score 32/40 80%

X
1. Policies That Promote Capital Deepening. Which of the following will promote
   economic growth through capital deepening?

   **C. Higher taxes used to finance universal health care.**


2. What part of government spending is excluded from GDP?

   **B. Transfer payments.**


X
3. The natural rate of unemployment consists of only

   **B. frictional and structural unemployment and is the rate of unemployment
   when there is no unemployment.**


4. Unlike the chain-weighted price index for GDP, the CPI asks how much a fixed
   basket of goods costs in the **current** year compared to the cost of those
   same goods in a **base** year. Because consumers tend to buy less of goods
   whose prices rise, the CPI will tend to **overstate** true changes in the
   cost of living.


5. High Prices and Inflation. Critically evaluate the following statement:
   "Tokyo is an expensive place to live. They must have a high inflation rate in
   Japan."

   **B. False. Inflation measures price changes, not price levels.**


6. The aggregate demand curve will shift from any of these four sources:

   **D. consumption spending, investment spending, government purchases, and net
   exports.**


X
7. Trade Deficits: Capital Deepening or Consumption? Suppose a country that had
   balanced trade began to run a trade deficit. At the same time, consumption as
   a share of GDP increased but the investment share did not. Do you think there
   was an increase in capital deepening?

   **D. Yes, because the trade deficit can be used to purchase more capital.**


8. The **short** run in macroeconomics is the period in which prices do not
   change or do not change very much. In the macroeconomic **short** run, both
   formal and informal contracts between firms mean that changes in demand will
   be reflected primarily in changes in **output**, not **prices**.


9. The key factors that cause shifts in aggregate demand do not include changes
   in:

   **D. productivity.**


10. Calculating the MPS and MPC. In one year, a consumer's income increases by
    \$200 and her savings increases by \$100

    Her marginal propensity to consume is equal to **0.5**.

    Her marginal propensity to save is equal to **0.5**.


11. Suppose that GDP is \$18 trillion in year 1, and \$19 trillion in year 2.
    Which of the following statements is true?

    **C. It will take 12.6 years for GDP to double**


12. Which of the following statements is true?

    **A. Real GDP is a measure of GDP that controls for changes in prices,
    whereas nominal GDP is the value of GDP in current dollars.**

    Economists divide GDP into four broad categories including:

    **B. consumption expenditures, private investment expenditures, government
    purchases, and net exports.**


13. To cut back on expenses, Lindsey decides to eliminate her maid service that
    costs her \$50 per week and do it herself.  Annual gross domestic product
    (GDP) would change by

    **C. -\$2,600**


14.  In the short run, when prices are slow to adjust to changes in demand and
     supply, **demand** determines production.


15. Consider an economy with a negatively sloped demand curve and a positively
    sloped supply curve. Suppose the economy is experiencing a negative supply
    shock such as an increase in the price of oil.

    Such a negative supply shock will shift the short-run **aggregate supply**
    curve to the left.

    As a result of the negative supply shock, short-run output **decreases** and
    the price level **increases**.


16. Alternative Unemployment Measures. An economy has 120,000,000 people
    employed, 7, 000, 000 unemployed, and 5, 000, 000 discouraged workers. The
    conventional measure of the unemployment rate is **5.51** percent.

    The best alternative measure that takes into account discouraged workers is
    an unemployment rate of **9.09** percent.


17. Karl recently lost his job as a steelworker because steel imports from China
    are cheaper than American-produced steel. Karl is **structurally** unemployed.

    Megan recently graduated from college, and she is currently in the job
    market seeking opportunities. Megan is **frictionally** unemployed.


X
18. Housework and Labor Statistics. Suppose the government decided that
    homemakers should be counted as employed because they perform important
    services. How do you think this change would affect our measure of the labor
    force, the labor force participation rate, and the unemployment rate?

    **C. The labor force and the labor force participation rate would increase
    but the unemployment rate would remain unchanged.**


19. State and Local Governments During Recessions. During recessions, state
    governments often will have to raise taxes and cut spending in order to keep
    their own budgets balanced. If a large number of states do this, at the
    national level, the aggregate demand curve will

    **A. shift to the left since both of these actions are contractionary.**


X
20. The Internet Crashes. Suppose that computer hackers managed to crash the
    Internet in the United States for a week and no one had computer access.

    This might be considered a negative supply shock because

    **A. fewer people would trust the Internet in the future.**


21. Diminishing Returns to Capital and Real Wages. Consider this statement:
    Since capital is subject to diminishing returns, an increase in the supply
    of capital will reduce real wages.

    This statement is wrong because an increase in the supply of capital will

    **D. increase the marginal benefit from employing labor and therefore
    increase the demand for labor and real wages.**


X/0.50
22. Which Professor Is Better Off? Suppose the starting salary for a new
    assistant economics professor was \$17,000 in 1976 and \$70,000 in 2014. The
    value of the CPI for 2014 was 236.7, compared to 56.9 in 1976.  A
    newly-hired professor earned more in real terms in **1976**, with a real
    salary of \$**41930**.


23. Europe versus the United States. In Europe, the average resident takes
    several weeks more of vacation time than in the United States. Per-capita
    income, however, is higher in the United States than the European average.

    **B. To compare the two regions in terms of true economic welfare, you would
    have to put some value on the additional leisure time.**


24. If the MPC is 0.75, then the multiplier is equal to **4**. If the government
    increases its purchases of goods and services by $16 million, GDP will
    increase by \$**64** million.


25. In a boom, real GDP exceeds potential GDP. This implies that

    **C. unemployment has fallen, driving wages up. This results in a leftward
    shift of the short-run aggregate supply curve.**


X/0.50
26. The "Brain Drain" and Incentives for Education. Some economists are
    concerned about the "brain drain," the phenomenon in which highly educated
    workers leave developing countries to work in developed countries. Other
    economists have argued that "brain drain" could create incentives for others
    in the country to secure increased education and many of the newly educated
    might not emigrate. Explain why the "brain drain" could lead to increased
    education among the remaining residents.

    **D. All of the above.**

    How would you test this theory?

    **D. All of the above.**


27. Individuals who have stopped looking for work because they could not find
    adequate childcare are not counted as unemployed in the traditional
    unemployment statistics. **True**

28. When calculating GDP using the production method, which of the following
    would you not include?

    **E. Value added.**


29. Depreciation and Automobiles. Suppose you buy a new car for \$25,000.  One
    year later it is worth \$18,750, and two years later it is worth \$16,500.
    The depreciation on the car

    **B. is 34 percent for the two years overall.**


30. Which of the following may influence technological progress?

    **D. All of the above.**


31. Higher saving leads to **higher** gross investment and will tend to
    **increase** the stock of capital available for production and result in
    **more** depreciation because there is **more** capital to depreciate.


32. We should be cautious in interpreting GDP as a measure of our economic
    well-being because it does not take into account

    **A. housework and childcare, leisure, the underground economy, or
    pollution.**


33. Sales versus Value Added. In comparing a small country's GDP to a major
    corporation, why is it best to use the value added of the corporation rather
    than its total sales?

    **A. Corporations typically buy goods such as inputs from many other
    companies to produce sales.**

    When we calculate GDP for a country, do we use the total sales of all goods
    and services?

    **B. No. GDP only includes the sale of final goods and services produced
    within a given year.**


34. A method for calculating price changes that takes an average of price
    changes using base years from consecutive years produces a

    **B. chain-weighted index.**


35. The nation of Abbalonia's GDP is growing at a rate of 4.9% per year. If it
    is able to sustain that growth consistently, it will take **14.3** years for
    the level of GDP in Abbalonia to double.


36. Most economists believe that in reality all the price indexes, including the
    chain-weighted index for GDP and the CPI, **overstate** actual changes in
    prices. In other words, the increase in prices is probably **less** than the
    reported indexes tell us. A principal reason for this is that we have a
    difficult time measuring **quality** improvements.


X
37. Cutting the Length of Patents. Suppose that a group of consumer activists
    claims that drug companies earn excessive profits because of the patents
    they have on drugs. The activists advocate cutting the length of time that a
    drug company can hold a patent to five years. They argue that this will lead
    to lower prices for drugs because competitors will enter the market after
    the five-year period.  Do you see any drawbacks to this proposal?

    **D. All of the above.**


X
38. The table below shows purchases for the small island of Renuzit.

    Renuzit's GDP was \$**187** million.

<center>

| Purchases                       | VAlue (in millions) |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| Consumption Expenditures        | \$79                |
| Private Investment Expenditures | \$31                |
| Government Purchases            | \$38                |
| Imports                         | \$39                |
| Exports                         | \$19                |

</center>


39. According to the Solow model, capital deepening will occur as long as

    **A. total saving exceeds depreciation.**


40. Individuals who want to work and have searched for work in the prior year,
    but are not currently looking for work because they believe they won't be
    able to find a job are called **discouraged** workers. They **are not**
    included in the labor force.

    Individuals who would like to work and have searched for work in the recent
    past, but have stopped looking for work for a variety of reasons are known
    as **marginally attached** workers. They **are not** included in the labor
    force.

    Workers who would like to be employed full time but hold part-time jobs are
    **employed** workers. These individuals **are** included in the labor force.

   **A. consumption spending, investment spending, government purchases, and net
   exports.**


9. Most economists believe that in reality all the price indexes, including the
   chain-weighted index for GDP and the CPI, **overstate** actual changes in
   prices. In other words, the increase in prices is probably **less** than the
   reported indexes tell us. A principal reason for this is that we have a

24. High Prices and Inflation. Critically evaluate the following statement:
    "Tokyo is an expensive place to live. They must have a high inflation rate
    in Japan."

    **A. False. Inflation measures price changes, not price levels.**
