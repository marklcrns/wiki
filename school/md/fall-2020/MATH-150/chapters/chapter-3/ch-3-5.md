# Chapter 3.5: Implicit Differentiation

Some functions are defined implicitly by a relation between $x$ and $y$ such as

## Equation 1

$$
x^{2} + y^{2} = 25
$$

or

## Equation 2

$$
x^{3} + y^{3} = 6xy
$$

In some cases it is possible to solve such an equation for $y$ as an explicit
function (or serveral functions) of $x$. For instance, if we solve Equation 1
for $y$, we get $y \pm\sqrt{25 - x^{2}}$, so two of the functions determinded by
the implicit Equation 1 are $f(x) = \sqrt{25 - x^{2}}$ and $g(x) = -\sqrt{25 -
x^{2}}$. The graphs of $f$ and $g$ are the upper and lower semicircles of the
circle $x^{2} + y^{2} = 25$.

It's not easy to solve Equation 2 for $y$ explicitly as a function of $x$ by
hand. Nonetheless, Equation 2 is the equation of a curve called **folium of
Descartes** shown in Figure 2 and it implicitly defines $y$ as several functions
of $x$. The graphs of three such functions are shown in Figure 3. When we say
that $f$ is a function implicitly by Equation 2, we mean that the equation

$$
x^{3} + [f(x)]^{3} = 6xf(x)
$$

is true for all values of $x$ in the domain of $f$.

Fortunately, we don't need to solve an equation for $y$ in terms of $x$ in order
to find the derivative of $y$. Instead we can use the method of implicit
differentiation.  This consists of differentiating both sides of the equation
with respect to $x$ and then solving the resulting equation for $y^{\prime}$. In
the examples and exercises of this section it is always assumed that the given
equation determines $y$ implicitly as a differentiable function of $x$ so that
the method of implicit differentiation can be applied.
