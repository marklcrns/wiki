### 3.2 Savings vs. Investments

In this module and later in the class you'll see the terms "savings" and
"investments" used quite a bit. For example, in the cash flow statement we'll
create in the module assignment there is a section called "Savings/Investments."
These terms might seem interchangeable: They both involve putting money aside
for the future instead of spending it in the present. In both there's an
expectation that your money will make more money (that is a "return" on your
savings or investment). And they can feel the same because in both cases it's
money that is put aside for the future. However, there is an important
difference that we should understand before moving forward:

In the field of personal finance, "savings" is often defined as stored money
(cash) that you own. It might be put into in a savings account, a Certificate of
Deposit (CD), a money market account, or even hidden under your mattress (not
advised). However your savings is stored, it's still essentially your cash.

Investing, on the other hand, is using your money to buy an asset that you think
will generate a return (that is, make more money) over time. So when you invest
you own something _other than cash_. Examples of investments include stocks
(partial ownership in companies), bonds (loans to companies or governments), and
real estate (ownership of land and/or the structures on the land).

Savings are typically used for short-term goals (three years or less) and
emergencies where you need access to your cash right away. Investments are
typically used for medium- or long-term goals (over three years) where you don't
need immediate access to your cash. Another way to say this is that savings are
more "liquid" than investments.

If you're interested in learning more about the role of saving vs. investing in
building wealth, [ðŸŒŽ here's a link to an article by Joshua Kennnon](https://www.thebalance.com/saving-money-vs-investing-money-358062)
explaining the different roles these play in managing our personal finances.

The chart below is a concise description of the differences between saving and
investing. Please review the differences to be sure you're familiar with these
concepts and then move on to the next page in this module.

| Saving                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Investing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Short-term: Ready to go**<br>Saving is typically for smaller, shorter-term goals in the near future (usually three years or less) like going on vacation or having money for an emergency.                                                                                                               | **Long-term: Achieve major goals**<br>Investing can help you reach bigger long-term goals (at least four to five years away), like saving for a childâ€™s college education.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Ready access to cash**<br>A savings account gives you access to ready cash when you need it. But many savings accounts do limit how often you can take your money out. Ask at your bank.                                                                                                                 | **Harder to access cash**<br>When you invest your money, itâ€™s typically not as easy to get your hands on it quickly as compared to a savings account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Minimal risk**<br>If your money is in an FDIC-insured savings account, itâ€™s at minimal or no risk, because your funds are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). That means that if anything ever happened to the bank, the FDIC insures each personâ€™s money to at least $250,000. | **Always involves risk**<br>You may lose some or all of the money you invest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Earn interest**<br>You can earn interest by putting money in a savings account, but savings accounts generally earn a lower return than investments.                                                                                                                                                     | **Potential for profit**<br>Investments have the potential for higher return than a regular savings account. Your investments may appreciate (go up in value) over time. This increases your net worth, which is the value of your assets (what you own) minus your liabilities (what you owe). If you sell for higher price than you invested initially, you make a profit. |

_Note: Remember: the greater the risk of an investment, the higher potential
return or loss of your money._

### 3.3 The Three Financial Statements

In the reading for this module we learned about the three common financial
statements used in business and personal finance. They are the income
statement, the cash flow statement, and the balance sheet. Sometimes it can get
confusing trying to distinguish among them. Here's a brief description that may
help:

- The **income statement** is a record of your recurring income and expenses
  over a period of time (usually one year). "Recurring" means they happen again
  and again (at least once per year). This basically shows the day-to-day
  operations of running your life; how money regularly comes in and regularly
  goes out.
- The **cash flow statement** is very similar to the income statement, but it
  includes everything that you've spent money on during a period of time
  (again, usually one year). "Everything" means non-recurring expenses as well
  as recurring expenses. So, for example, if you bought a car during this time
  period that would appear on the cash flow statement but not on the income
  statement.
- The **balance sheet** is a snapshot in time of your assets and liabilities;
  that is, everything you own and everything you owe. The balance sheet is
  unlike the other two statements because it does not cover a period of time at
  all; it's just an instantaneous record, sort of like an inventory.

At the end of this module you will create your own cash flow statement and your
own balance sheet. We're not going to create an income statement because 1) I
think it's more helpful to have a record of everything that you spend money on;
not just the recurring items, and 2) The two statements are very similar.

Together, these statements answer the questions "where am I?" and "what
happened?" The balance sheet tells you where you are in terms of your finances
- what you have and what you owe. And the cash flow statement tells you what
happened - where your money came from and where it went. It's a great idea to
update these statements periodically (every year is most common) so you can
keep track of your financial situation as you go through life.

As I indicated earlier, the terms you see in the spreadsheet we'll use for
these two statements might be a little different than the terms used in the
book, and they also might be a little different than the terms you see from
other sources. The important part is to understand the basic concepts and
procedures.

### 3.4 Keeping Track of Financial Records

To create your cash flow statement and balance sheet during the "Activities"
portion of this module you will need to find and enter information about your
financial situation: Things like what your financial accounts, physical
property that you own, your income, and how you spend your money. You probably
won't be able to exactly account for every dollar of these items (I can't), but
you will need to be able to estimate them to a reasonably accurate level.
Usually this kind of information can be found on a variety of documents. Here
are some common ones:

Recent pay stubs Tax returns Bank statements Bill payment records Credit card
statements Checkbook register or a log of checks paid Monthly debit card
transactions Investment account statements

Many people take a while to find all of these because they don't have them
organized in a way that makes it easy to access them. Also, it's difficult to
know where we should store some of them. For example, should we keep a hard
copy or PDF record of our savings account statement each month? Or is it OK to
just be able to access it online? What about things like marriage certificates
or life insurance documents?

Laura D. Adams, a financial educator and creator of the "Moneygirl" podcast has
created a "blueprint" of suggestions about how to store and access various
kinds of personal finance records. A copy of the blueprint is available below;
please feel free to download and view it if you think it will be helpful. I've
enjoyed listening to Ms. Adams' podcasts for several years; she has a great
knack of providing a lot of good personal finance information in short, easy to
understand podcasts. You can learn more about her work and free materials at

### 3.5 Net Worth and Savings Rate

#### Total Net Worth

The usual way we calculate net worth for an individual (or for a company) is to
add up everything the person owns - money, stocks, retirement accounts, car,
clothes, house, etc. - and then subtract everything the person owes - home
mortgage, car loan, personal loan, education loan, etc. The remainder is the
person's "Net Worth." This calculation is done on the balance sheet.

This is a useful way to see what you're "worth" overall, but I don't think it's
very useful in helping us to make decisions about our personal finances. Why
not? Because for the most part our tangible assets - our physical possessions -
are not really things we can easily convert to cash for other uses. (In other
words, tangible assets are not very liquid.) For example, if you own your own
home it is certainly an asset, but not one that you can easily convert to cash
unless you plan to sell or refinance it. Similarly, our long-term liabilities -
that is, loans that come due longer than one year in the future - are also not
very liquid. These types of loans do affect our cash flow because we have to
pay principal and interest on them, but they don't have a significant affect on
our financial position (at least in the short term) because they're paid off
over a long period of time - typically over many years. Also, long term loans
are usually used to finance tangible assets. For example, a home mortgage is
used to finance a home.

#### Financial Net Worth

In addition to Total Net Worth, I like to look at "Financial Net Worth," which
excludes tangible assets and long-term liabilities. Financial Net Worth shows
us how much money we would have if we paid off all of our short-term debts
(those due within a year or less) but did not sell any of our tangible
property. It's basically a measure of our net worth that is relatively liquid.
That is, the portion of our net worth that can be converted to cash relatively
quickly and easily.

That said, there is no set rule about this. If you want to include a home that
you own among your financial assets then please go ahead and list it that way
on your balance sheet if you actually treat it as a financial asset. You might
choose to do that, for example, if you own the home for investment purposes and
not necessarily as a place of residence. The important thing is to account for
all your assets and liabilities in a way that makes sense to you and to do it
consistently so that you can see changes over time.

#### Savings Rate

Another reason Financial Net Worth is helpful is because it allows us to
calculate a savings rate. The savings rate is the change in your savings and
investments over a period of time (usually a year). If you calculate your
Financial Net Worth every year, you can use the difference between these
amounts from year to year to see how much and how quickly you are saving.
Financial Net Worth takes all of your financial factors into account - your
assets as well as your liabilities - so it's sort of a "total picture" of where
your finances are. You would not want your tangible assets to be included in
this kind of analysis because many tangible assets decline in value (or
"depreciate") over time. For example, a car you've been driving for ten years
is worth less today than when you first bought it ten years ago. You would not
want to include the car in your calculation of a savings rate because the
decline in the car's value would make it look like you are saving less than you
really are.

### 3.6 Software Tools

In the reading for this module we learned a little about software that can be
used to help us manage our finances. Software and the technology that supports
it changes rapidly and so there are new products available today that were not
available even a few years ago.

My own opinion is that personal finance software is not really necessary. I
don't use any particular software to manage my personal finances, other than
Excel spreadsheets. I've tried one or two personal finance software products,
but I found that they took more time and effort than I was willing to devote to
them. That said, you may want to try out some personal finance software and see
how it works for you.

Laura D. Adams, a financial educator and creator of the "Moneygirl" podcast has
created a page of recommended personal finance software tools.

### 3.7 Avoid Wasting Time

The last thing I want to share before we move on to the Assignments section of
this module is the idea of using our time effectively in managing our finances.
I've known some people who track and account for every dollar they spend,
sometimes listing them in large spreadsheets or entering them in a software
system like Quicken. I think it's great to do that if you enjoy spending your
time that way. I also think it's a very productive exercise to closely track
your expenses for a couple of weeks (we'll do that in this class). But I don't
think it's a good use of time to do this on an ongoing basis. Why? Because most
of us are busy and there are much more effective ways to use the limited time
we have available for managing my personal finances. For example, I think it's
much more helpful to update my cash flow statement and my balance sheet and to
create a budget every year than it is to track each individual thing I spend
money on. The financial statements give me the "big picture" on where my
finances are; not the unnecessary detail about every transaction I make.

There are other helpful ways to save time in managing your finances. For
example, many companies allow you to pay your monthly bills by automatic
deduction from your checking account. Or you can pay bills electronically from
your bank's website. I think it's also a good idea to set aside some time on
the same day each week to do this kind of work - it cuts down on the amount of
time you spend dealing with finances if you do them all at once on a periodic
basis.
