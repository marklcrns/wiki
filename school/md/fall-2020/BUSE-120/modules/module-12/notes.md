# Module 12: Investor and Market Behavior

## BUSE 120 Canvas Notes

### 12.2 Our Biased Thinking

#### Behavioral Biases

In the reading for this module we learned about the concept of behavioral biases
that can affect our financial decision making. Behavioral biases are preferences
or beliefs that interfere with our ability to think objectively, particularly
about our money and investments. (I think this is a fascinating field of study
with a lot of relevance for individual investors.)

Our textbook provided a few examples of behavioral biases, such as availability
and representativeness. The link below will bring you to a short article
describing some other types of biases that are common problems in investing.
There's also a video right under the link that describes some common cognitive
errors that happen in many different areas of life (not just our finances).
Please either read the article or view the video (or ideally both), click on the
"Mark as Done" button at the top of the page, and then continue reading this
page.

#### Recency Bias

Jill Schlesinger, author of [ðŸ“„ The Dumb Things Smart People Do with Their
Money](https://www.jillonmoney.com/book) believes that recency bias is one of
the most common errors we make in investing. Recency bias is the tendency for us
to believe that events that happened most recently are the ones that are most
likely to happen in the future. For example, many people feel an impulse to buy
into the stock market when stock prices are rising, because recency bias makes
us think that they will continue to rise. It's sort of a "short term thinking"
phenomenon.

Here's what Schlesinger has to say about recency bias:

The tendency to remember recent events more vividly and give recent information
more weight than historical information, can cause us to believe that what's
happened recently will continue to occur. Investors are constantly influenced by
this bias: When stocks are trading higher, they erroneously believe that the
trend will persist and when they tumble, they cash out and hide, thinking that
stocks will hurtle towards zero. Recency bias is the reason that securities law
requires that every investment disclosure contain this sentence: "Past
performance is no guarantee of future results." While many gloss over the
warning, they do so at their own peril--these investors may chase performance,
ultimately causing them to underperform the very indexes into which they have
poured their money. When markets are reaching new highs or lows, fight this bias
by returning to the reasons that you are investing and remind yourself that
there is no reason to alter your plan.

Schlesinger suggests that recency bias is a big reason why an active investment
strategy (one in which individual investors or managers try to actively buy and
sell investments in order to make the most money) does more poorly overall than
a passive investment strategy (one in which investors purchase index funds and
just hold the investment in order to achieve the average return of the market).

#### Framing

In addition to behavioral biases, one of the most important concepts from this
module is the idea of "framing." Framing refers to the context in which we
define a decision, its possible alternatives, and potential outcomes. Framing
can lead us to shortsighted views, narrow-minded assumptions, and restricted
choices. And these problems can have an effect on our decisions about
investments (and about many other areas of our lives).

The video below explains the concept of framing in more detail. Please watch the
video, then continue on to the next page in this module.

### 12.3 Financial Bubbles and Fraud

#### Financial Bubbles

In the reading for this module we learned a little bit about the typical pattern
of a financial bubble and crisis. The typical steps in a financial crisis are:

1. New discovery
2. Economic expansion 
3. Increased production and wealth
4. Lower interest rates; increased credit
5. Asset bubble
6. Market correction or crash

There have been financial bubbles and crises throughout history. One (perhaps
the first) was the "Tulip Mania" of the 17th century. The video below uses the
"Tulip Mania" to help explain how a financial bubble and the resulting crisis
happens. While this video is about tulips, the principles apply to all kinds of
assets that develop into bubbles, such as real estate or tech stocks. Please
view the video and then continue on with this page.

#### Financial Fraud

Financial fraud is an intentional act of deception involving financial
transactions for purpose of personal or corporate gain. Fraud can take many
forms, such as the "pyramid scheme" that we learned about in the reading for
this module.

The short video below is about how to spot investment fraud. Please watch the
video and then continue on to the next page in this module. If you'd like more
information about types of financial fraud and how to avoid it, please visit the

### 12.4 Getting Investment Information

#### Market Data

In the reading for this module we learned about different sources of economic
indicators and market data. One example is the S&P 500, which is an index of the
500 largest U.S. corporations (by capital value). We often hear about economic
indicators and market data in the news, but sometimes just in piecemeal form -
that is, we get one or two measures but not a complete picture.

The link below will bring you to a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(FINRA) webpage of market data. Please take a look at the page to see the
indices and other types of information that are available here. While you're on
the page, please click on at least one of the links at the left to investigate
other types of financial information. For example, you can research individual
publicly-traded companies through the "Company Information" link or you can look
up stock prices on the "Equities and Options" link. Once you're done, please
click on the "Mark as Done" button at the top of the page indicating that you're
familiar with the resources on this website and then move on to the topic on
this page.

- [ðŸ“„ Market Data from FINRA](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/Default.jsp)

Note: You'll need to enter the stock ticker abbreviation for any company or
stock you want to research. You can find these by using a Google search for the
company's stock ticker, or you can just start typing in the company's name on
the FINRA site and see what comes up. For example, Disney's stock ticker is
"DIS" so you can find this just by typing in the company's name.

#### Historical Stock and Bond Returns

While visiting the FINRA Market Data website you probably saw some data about
the historical returns of an investment (that is, how much the investment has
increased or decreased in value over the last month or year or whatever). You
might have wondered what a "normal" rate of return is.

Having a good feel for "normal" or historical average rates of return is
important in planning our investments. In particular, it's sometimes tempting to
come up with high expectations of the return on our investment so we can feel
like we're investing enough money. Conversely, we sometimes underestimate how
much we can earn on our investment because we want to "play it safe" or keep
ourselves from having unrealistic expectations that will lead to future
disappointment.

According to David Blanchett in The Wall Street Journal, the average return on
large-cap stocks (that is, stocks of large companies) has historically been
around 7% after inflation. The average return for government bonds has been
around 5% historically, but only around 2% in recent years. Of course, no one
knows for sure what kids of returns stocks and bonds will provide in the future.

#### Evaluating Online Financial Information

You may have noticed that in this class I direct us to a lot of
government-created or government-sponsored websites for information (although I
use some that are not government websites as well.) There are several reasons I
do that, but the most important is because government-funded sources of
financial information are typically unbiased compared to many other sources of
information. This is because the government is not trying to sell you anything
or make a profit from your visit to their website. Many other sources of
financial information are biased in one way or another because they are trying
to influence you to buy a particular product or to link from that website to the
website of one of their paid advertisers. In fact, some websites publish
""articles" that are really advertisements written to appear like articles and
are produced by the website's paid advertisers.

When looking at any content online (or elsewhere for that matter), whether it's
about personal finance or any other topic, you should evaluate the reliability
of the source and ask yourself what kind of content you're looking at.
Specifically, is it:

- Information (unbiased facts),
- Opinion (someone's interpretation of the facts), or
- Propaganda (someone trying to influence your own opinion or actions)?

It can be really hard to tell these apart, and often they are combined into one
content item. For example, an article may tell you the unemployment rate
(information), explain that it was caused by a government policy (opinion), and
then point out that a particular political candidate is opposed to that
government policy (propaganda).

One way to do a very quick evaluation about the source of the online content is
by looking at the source's website address extension. For example,.com
extensions are used by for-profit companies, while.gov extensions are used by
government organizations. A list of website address extensions is provided
below:

### 12.5 Brokers and Fiduciaries

#### About Brokers

In the reading for this module we learned that a "broker" is someone who makes
financial trades, such as buying or selling stocks, on behalf of a client. There
are different levels of brokerage services. Some levels of service, like
discretionary or advisory trading, involve the broker either making decisions
for the client or giving the client investment advice and guidance. This seems
good, but unfortunately many brokers are not actually required to act in their
client's best interests by giving them good advice. In fact, some brokers
function more like salespeople who earn a commission by selling financial
products to their clients rather than true impartial advisors. As a result,
investment salespeople may recommend investment practices that result in higher
fees and lower returns, such as:

Recommending investment products with high commissions, such as limited
partnerships, annuities, and load mutual funds.  Recommending active instead of
passive trading, since the investment salesperson may earn a commission on each
transaction.  Failing to recommend investing through tax-advantaged
employer-sponsored retirement plans; since these are set up by the employer, the
salesperson does not have any financial incentive for you to invest in this way.
Recommending high-fee investment options.

In Module 2 we covered some guidance about financial advisors, including
questions that you should ask anyone recommending that you buy a particular
financial product. Please click on the link below if you'd like to revisit that
important information:

- [ðŸ“‘ Financial Advisors](../module-2/notes.md#financial-advisors)

#### About Fiduciaries

The last concept I'd like to go over in this module is the idea of a
"fiduciary." A fiduciary is someone who is required by law to act in their
client's best interests. In other words, fiduciaries are required to provide you
(the client) with the best advice they can regardless of whether it benefits
them personally. A fiduciary is probably the best person to provide you with
investment advice and guidance because they are required to act in your best
interest.

Many brokers and other financial advisors are not fiduciaries. I think it's
totally fine to use non-fiduciaries to help manage your finances, but I suggest
you be very cautious about taking any investment advice or guidance from them.
In other words, non-fiduciaries are fine for carrying out your investment
instructions (such as in execution-only brokerage services) but are probably not
a good choice for providing impartial advice. 

The short video below explains the difference between fiduciaries and
non-fiduciaries. Please watch the video, click on the "Mark as Done" button at
the top of the page indicating you're familiar with the difference between a
broker and a fiduciary, and then move on to the assignment for this module.
