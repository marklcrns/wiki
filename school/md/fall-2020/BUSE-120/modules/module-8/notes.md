### 8.2 Weighted Scoring Decision Making Technique

In the reading for this module we saw an example of product-attribute scoring.
This weighted scoring technique is a tool commonly used in other areas of
business (not just personal finance) to help us make decisions when comparing
multiple options. It's used for all kinds of decisions; not just decisions about
what to buy. I think it's quite useful for helping us to think clearly about the
criteria for a decision and how the different options meet those criteria. The
link below is an Excel spreadsheet that you can use to help apply this technique
(the spreadsheet is something I teach and use in my BUSE 201 Business
Organization and Management class). Please feel free to download and keep the
spreadsheet if you'd like.

If you're interested in learning more about this technique, the video below
explains how do do weighted scoring in more detail. Again, this technique can be
used for any decision - not just decisions about products to buy - so the video
is more of a general overview. Once you're done watching the video (if you
choose to) please move on to the next page in this module.

### 8.3 Buying or Leasing a Car

For many people, a car is the second most expensive purchase they will ever make
(after a home). It's very easy to get caught up in the excitement of buying a
car and not pay attention to the financial details. Car buying can be more
complicated because of all the options in how we buy a car: New vs. used, buy
vs. lease, and financing options for example.

#### Consumer Reports Car Buying Guides

I think Consumer Reports is a great place to find unbiased information about
purchases (like cars) because they're an independent, nonprofit organization
that doesn't accept any funding from advertising or commercial sources. So their
incentives are to provide the best information for the buyers of products and
services (the consumers), not the sellers of products and services. This is
unlike most other sources of information about products and services that you
can find on the Internet. If you're thinking of buying a car, you may find it
valuable to visit the Consumer Reports car buying guide. It is available via the
link below. When you're done looking at the website (if you choose to), please
return and continue with this page.

#### Leasing vs. Buying a Car

In the reading assignment for this module we learned about the difference
between a lease and a purchase. Leases are a common alternative to buying a car.
A lease is a long-term rental agreement with an option to buy at the end of the
rental period. Depending on how long you plan to own the car, it might make
sense to lease or to own. For example, if you plan to own the car for a long
period of time (until it costs more to repair it than to replace it) then it's
probably best to buy the car outright. On the other hand, if you intend to keep
the car for just a few years and then to replace it with another new car, then
it may be best to lease.

You can also calculate the best financial choice between leasing and buying a
car. If you're interested in learning more about this topic, click on the link
below to visit the "Lease or Purchase" calculator at the [ðŸŒŽ Smart About
Money](https://www.smartaboutmoney.org/) website, sponsored by the [ðŸŒŽ National
Endowment for Financial Education](https://www.nefe.org/). Please feel free to
plug in some numbers to see which option makes the most financial sense if this
interests you, then return and continue on with the next page in this module.

### 8.4 Buying or Renting a Home

In the reading assignment for this module we learned about housing costs and
decisions, including information about renting and buying a home. There are a
lot of tools available on the Internet to help you learn more about housing
costs and options. One of them - a mortgage shopping checklist from the [ðŸŒŽ
Federal Reserve Board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) - is attached below.
Please feel free to download and use it when shopping for a home mortgage. I
think it's particularly helpful in comparing different home mortgage options
because it includes a list of questions to ask about the loan options, in
addition to the basic loan information.

The link below will bring you to a list of other resources about buying or
renting a home from the [ðŸŒŽ Smart About Money](https://www.smartaboutmoney.org/)
website, sponsored by the [ðŸŒŽ National Endowment for Financial
Education](https://www.nefe.org/). Please take a look at the resources on this
page and then follow and read through at least one resource that interests you
(but more than one if you would like - they're all great sources of
information).

- [ðŸŒŽ Manage Housing Costs](https://www.smartaboutmoney.org/Topics/Housing-and-Transportation/Manage-Housing-Costs)

#### 8.4.1 Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages

In the reading for this chapter we learned about a variety of home mortgage
options. The two basic categories are fixed rate mortgages, in which the
interest rate stays the same during the life of the loan and adjustable rate
mortgages, in which the interest rate can vary during the life of the loan.
(There are different subcategories of adjustable rate mortgages as well.)

Below is a short video from the Bank of America describing the basic difference
between fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages. Please view the video and then
return and continue on with the next page in this module.

#### 8.4.2 Mortgage Calculator

Before shopping for a home, it's necessary to identify the amount of money you
can spend on your mortgage each month. It's important to establish this payment
amount so that you don't waste time shopping for an expensive home that you
can't afford, or conversely for an inexpensive home that doesn't meet your needs
and desires. The monthly payment is dependent on the following factors:

- The price of the home
- The down payment
- The loan term
- The interest rate of the loan
- Other monthly costs such as homeowners insurance, taxes, Private Mortgage
  Insurance (PMI), Homeowners Association fees (HOA), home maintenance, and
  utilities.

Together, these factors will allow you to calculate the total monthly payment
that you would make on a home mortgage. This can then be incorporated into your
monthly budget.

As we learned in the reading and a previous page in this module, the rate and
term of the loan can be either fixed or variable. If you select a variable rate
loan, the monthly payment may change over the life of the loan.

Please open the Mortgage Calculator webpage at the link below:

- [ðŸŒŽ Mortgage Calculator from calculator.net](https://www.calculator.net/mortgage-calculator.html)

Once you have the calculator open, please follow the steps below to learn more
about how to use it:

1. Enter the following example information:

- Home price: \$300,000
- Down payment: 20% (this means you will pay \$60,000 "up front." A down payment
  of at least 20% is usually required to be exempt from PMI.)
- Loan term: 30 years
- Interest rate: 5%
- Property taxes: 1.2%
- Homeowners' Insurance: \$2,000 per year
- PMI: 0% (because you are putting 20% down)
- HOA: 0% (because you are not buying a property that is part of a homeowner's
  association)
- Other costs: \$3,000 per year for home maintenance and utilities

After completing the calculation, notice how much of the total payment over the
life of the loan is made up of interest (it should be 31%) versus principal
(33%). That means you are paying almost as much in interest as you are for the
actual price of the home. Also notice on the "mortgage amortization graph" that
the interest you pay gradually tapers off over time. This is because as you pay
down the loan, you owe less to the lender and so the amount of interest as a
proportion of your monthly payment declines.

2. Now change the term of the loan from 30 years to 15 years and recalculate.
   Notice what happens to the amount of interest (it should have declined to
   22%). Notice also that the monthly payment has increased (because you're
   paying more per month to pay off the loan in half the amount of time).
   Lenders often offer a better interest rate for 15 year fixed rate mortgages.
   So change the interest rate from 5% to 4.5% and see what happens to the
   payment and the amount of interest (both should decline).

3. Change the term of the loan back to 30 years and the interest rate back to
   5%. The monthly payment should be \$1,288.37.

4. Change the interest rate to 7.5% (this is the interest rate I got on my first
   home mortgage) and recalculate. Notice what happens to the monthly payment
   and the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.

5. Reduce the interest rate to 3.5% (this is around the lowest interest rate
   that was available from 2009 to 2019) and recalculate. Notice what happens to
   the monthly payment and the amount of interest paid over the life of the
   loan. You can see that the interest rate has an enormous effect on the
   characteristics of the loan. For this reason, many borrowers are willing to
   pay "points" - additional money up front - in order to buy a lower interest
   rate over the life of the loan. "Points" are essentially prepaid interest. It
   might make sense to pay points if you are going to keep the mortgage on your
   home for a long time and want the lowest possible interest rate. On the other
   hand, it may not make sense to pay points if you might move or refinance your
   mortgage in the future.

6. Change the term of the loan back to 30 years and the interest rate back to
   5%. The monthly payment should be \$1,288.37.

7. Change the price of the home to \$592,700 and recalculate. (This was the
   median price of a home in San Diego County at the end of 2018.) Notice what
   happens to the monthly payment.

8. Experiment with changing the home price on this calculator until you get to a
   monthly payment that you can afford in your budget. (Remember to be
   conservative in your budget estimates.) You can also experiment with
   different interest rates. Current and historical home mortgage interest rates
   can be found at [ðŸŒŽ
   www.bankrate.com](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/current-interest-rates.aspx)
   or other sources on the Internet.

9. Change the price of the loan back to \$300,000, the term of the loan back to
   30 years, and the interest rate back to 5%. The monthly payment should be
   \$1,288.37. Change the down payment to 0% and change PMI from \$0 to \$3,000
   per year and recalculate. Notice what happens to the monthly payment. This is
   what happens if you don't provide a down payment for a home. That's why many
   experts recommend that you save enough for a down payment before you buy a
   home. Lenders usually require at least a 20% down payment to avoid paying for
   PMI.

Feel free to experiment more with this calculator and to investigate more about
home mortgages on the Internet. When you're done, please click on the "Mark as
Done" button at the top of the page to indicate you're familiar with how to use
the calculator and then move on to the next page in the module.

#### 8.4.3 Choosing a Real Estate Agent

If you decide to buy a home, you will most likely work with a real estate
agents. A good agent can be instrumental in helping you make a good purchase. A
bad agent, on the other hand, can make it a very bad and costly experience. 

Real estate agents work on commission, which means they keep a percentage of the
sales price of the home as they pay for arranging the sale. The commission
system creates some potential conflicts of interest, such as:

- Real estate agents earn more by getting you to buy a more expensive home.
- Real estate agents spend less time and resources by getting you to buy
- quickly.  Real estate agents sometimes earn more by getting you to buy a home
- listed with another agent in their office.

What should you look for in a real estate agent? Eric Tyson, MBA, author of
"Personal Finance for Dummies (Links to an external site.)," recommends looking
for the following traits:

- Full-time employment as a real estate agent
- Experience
- Honesty and integrity
- Interpersonal skills
- Negotiating skills
- High quality standards
- Patience
- Knowledge of the local market and community
- Knowledge of financing

### 8.5 Consumer Information Resources

This course covers only the very basics of consumer information. Many people
have specific questions or issues that they want more information and help with.
Here are some additional resources you might be interested in:

- [ðŸŒŽ Federal Reserve Board's Consumer Help
  website](https://www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov/?sc_lang=en). Information

  foreclosure and debt collection, and identity theft. 
- [ðŸŒŽ Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/).
  The government agency responsible for ensuring that financial institutions
  treat their customers fairly. Their "Consumer Tools" page has links to
  information about loans, credit cards, debt collection, mortgages, and other
  helpful information.
- [ðŸŒŽ Smart About Money topics page](https://www.smartaboutmoney.org/Topics). A
  broad range of consumer financial topics such as financial fraud; career
