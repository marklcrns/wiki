## BUSE 120 Canvas Notes

### 11.2 Investment Terms and Types

#### Investment Terms

The reading assignment for this chapter contained a lot of terms and definitions
about investments. It's important for you to learn the basic terms used in
investing so that you're able to understand the content presented in the
remaining modules and also the information you'll find elsewhere about
investing. In fact, you've probably already heard a lot of investment terms used
in the news and elsewhere and you may not be sure what all of them mean.

The link below will bring you to a short article from the [ðŸ“„
Investorjunkie](https://investorjunkie.com/) website that defines common
investment terms (including some that were not covered in the reading for this
module). Please read the article and then return and continue with this page.

#### Investment Types

In the reading for this chapter we learned about some of the basic
characteristics of different kinds of investments, such as stocks, bonds, and
commodities. The link below will bring you to a page on the [ðŸ“„ Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)](http://www.finra.org/) website that
provides descriptions about these and other types of investments. Please look
over the page and then follow at least one of the links to learn more about an
investment category that interests you. When you're done, please click on the
"Mark as Done" button at the top of the page to indicate you've read through at
least one investment category. Then move on to the next page in this module.

### 11.3 Risk, Return, and Diversification

One of the most important concepts in this module is the relationship between
risk and return. "Risk" is a measure of variability - that is, how much an
investment's value varies over time. This variability can be measured using
statistically by calculating the "variance" or the "standard deviation" of the
change over time. "Return" is the change in value of the investment over time.
Risk and return are related to each other - higher risk results in higher
expected or potential return (on average over time), and vice-versa.

The short video below explains this relationship in more detail and provides
some examples. Please watch the video and then continue with this page.

Wouldn't it be nice if there was some way to lower the risk and still get a high
return? It turns out that there is! It's called "diversification."
Diversification means spreading risks out by investing in a variety of asset
classes that have different types of risk. The assets each all go up and down in
value of course (that's what risk is). But they don't always go up and down in
value at the same time, in the same direction, or to the same degree. Therefore,
the overall collection or "portfolio" of investments doesn't vary as much as an
individual investment in the portfolio does.

It's a neat trick.

The short video below explains diversification in a little more detail. Please
watch the video and then continue on to the next page in the module.

### 11.4 Derivatives and Margin Trading

#### Derivatives

In the reading for this module we learned that a "derivative" is the term for
any financial instrument whose value is derived from the value of another
security. The textbook used the example of a contract to buy wheat produced in
the future at a particular price. When you do that, you're essentially betting
that the price you can sell the wheat for in the future will be higher than the
price at which you've agreed to buy the future wheat. The value of your
investment, then, is derived from the future price of the wheat. If the price of
wheat is high in the future, then your contract will be worth more. If the price
of wheat is low in the future, then your contract will be worth less.

Derivatives can be a risky form of investing because they're based on uncertain
future conditions of other securities. They can also become much more
complicated than the example presented in the textbook.

The short video below explains derivatives in a little more detail. Please watch
the video, then continue on to the next topic on this page.

#### Margin Trading

"Margin trading," "buying on margin," and "leveraged investing" all mean the
same thing: It's borrowing money to use for an investment such as a stock.
Margin trading potentially allows an investor to make a greater return on their
investment, because they are earning a return not just on their own money but
also on someone else's money (the loan amount). Similarly, buying on margin
poses much greater risk of loss for the investor, because if the investment
loses money they still have to pay back the total amount of the loan. Basically
it's a way to magnify the percentage gained or lost in an investment.

The short video below provides an explanation of buying on margin. Please watch
the video and then continue on to the next page in this module.

### 11.5 Investment Strategies

In the reading for this module we learned about "investment strategies," which
are used for deciding what to do with the money we devote to savings and
investments. They help us plan our investment on three levels:

- Capital allocation, which diversifies between riskless investments (like
  savings) and other investments that include some level of risk;
- Asset allocation, which diversifies among asset classes such as stocks, bonds,
  and other investments (commodities, real estate, and collectables); and
- Security selection, which diversifies among specific investment choices in
  each asset class (for example, among specific mutual funds or individual
  stocks).

You will create your own investment strategy as an exercise in a future module,
so please be sure to read that section of the textbook (12.4) carefully.
