# Module 15: Mutual Funds and Other Investments

## BUSE 120 Canvas Notes

### 15.2 About Mutual Funds

#### Mutual Fund Basics

A mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) is not an investment in and of
itself, but rather a way to own a variety of other investments. A mutual fund
has two main advantages:

1. Diversification, because the fund owns a wide portfolio of securities
   consisting of stocks, bonds, and/or other types of securities.
2. Convenience, because you can make one transaction to buy or sell many
   securities at the same time that together make up the mutual fund's
   portfolio.

Mutual funds and ETFs have other advantages, including professional management,
low minimums for an initial investment, and flexibility in risk level and
investment type because of all the funds one can choose from. Different mutual
funds and ETFs invest in:

- Stocks
- Bonds
- Combinations of stocks and bonds (called "balanced funds")
- Combinations of stocks and bonds that gradually reduce risk as they approach a
- target retirement date (called "target date" funds)
- Short-term cash equivalents (called "money market funds")
- Stock in particular industry sectors
- Stock in companies of particular sizes or types

... and many other blends or types of investments.

The returns generated by mutual funds and ETFs comes from three sources:

- Dividends and/or interest from the investment securities in the fund's
  portfolio
- Capital gains resulting from sales of investment securities in the fund's
  portfolio
- Changes in the prices of investment securities in the fund's portfolio

The link below will bring you to some basic information about mutual funds
provided by the [ðŸ“„ Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(FINRA)](http://www.finra.org/).

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are mutual funds that are traded like common
stocks. Shares of ETFs trade like stocks on a stock exchange and can be bought
and sold during the day just like stocks.

The short video below from The Wall Street Journal explains the difference
between mutual funds and ETFs. Please watch the video and then return and
continue on to the next topic on this page.

#### Mutual Fund and ETF Fees

Mutual funds and ETFs can charge a variety of fees. These include fees for
managing the fund and (in some cases) for buying or selling shares of the fund.
The fees for buying or selling shares of the fund are called "load." They are
often quite large - from 1% to 6% or higher of the value of the shares being
bought or sold. Mutual funds that charge a load can significantly reduce your
return from owning the fund, because the load takes away much of your investment
gains. For that reason, many financial advisors recommend that you only invest
in no-load mutual funds.

Similarly, the management and other fees that a mutual fund or ETF charges takes
away from your investment returns. For example, if your mutual fund makes a 5%
annual return on your investment but the fund charges 1% in annual fees, you
really only made a 4% annual return. In other words, 20% of your investment
returns (the money your investment earned) went to the fund managers rather than
to you. Some companies specialize in no-load, low-fee mutual funds, including at
least one that is owned directly by the investors themselves (Vanguard). For

    mutual funds.

### 15.3 About REITs

In the reading for this module we learned about various ways to invest in real
estate. One basic method is through direct investment - that is, buying real
estate directly and then renting it out or reselling it on your own. The other
basic method is through indirect investment - buying shares in an entity or
group that owns real estate. One of the most common ways to invest indirectly in
real estate is through a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).

### 15.4 Investment Advisors and Robo-Advisors

#### Investment Advisors and the (Now Dead) Fiduciary Rule

As we learned in an earlier module, there are plenty of people available to give
you advice about investing. Some of these are essentially salespeople, who make
their living off of the commissions they earn from convincing you to invest in
particular products. Others are fiduciaries, who are required by law to act in
your best interest when giving financial advice. Instead of earning a commission
by getting you to invest in particular products, fiduciaries usually charge a
flat fee or a percentage of the total assets you have invested. Here's an
explanation of the difference by [ðŸ“„ The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/)
that was published in the San Diego Union-Tribune on October 29, 2017:

    Many people who work as financial advisers aren't legally required to have their
    clients' best interests at heart. Unlike lawyers or doctors, who are bound by
    oath to do no harm or to represent their clients' interests faithfully,
    financial planners and advisers are free to sell any manner of subpar products.

    The "fiduciary rule," proposed under the Obama administration, seeks to resolve
    this conflict by making advisers legally bound to serve their clients' interests
    in matters related to retirement accounts. (Some already do so, of course.) It
    hasn't fully taken effect yet, though, and the new administration in Washington
    is reviewing the rule, with its future hanging in the balance.

    Why would anyone object to the rule? Well, it all comes down to fees. Even a
    small difference in the fees between one investment and another can make a huge
    difference over a long period. When financial advisers recommend high-fee
    products in order to line their own pockets, it hurts your ability to save for
    retirement. This can happen if, for example, a financial adviser was being paid
    a commission by a mutual fund to steer people toward that particular fund.

    The problem is systemic. A study of the 1.2 million financial advisers
    registered in the U.S. from 2005 to 2015 found that 7 percent of them had
    misconduct on their records. The problem is even more pronounced at big firms,
    where as many as 15 percent of advisers have a stained record. To make matters
    worse, "Roughly one third of advisers with misconduct are repeat offenders." The
    White House noted last year that "conflicts of interest in retirement advice
    cost America's families an estimated $17 billion a year."

    Even if the worst happens and the fiduciary rule is struck down, you can still
    take steps to protect yourself. If you have a financial adviser, make sure they
    are a fiduciary and legally required to put your interests first. Advisers
    designated as "fee only" won't be looking to earn commissions from selling you
    products, and you can seek one at napfa.org.

In mid-2018, as the article puts it, the "worst happened": The fiduciary rule
was reversed by the courts. So investment advisors are still not required to act
in their clients' best interests - instead they can continue to recommend
investments that primarily benefit themselves rather than their customers.

What does this mean for me and you? In an [ðŸ“„ article published by Market
Watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/is-the-fiduciary-rule-dead-or-alive-what-its-fate-means-to-you-2018-03-16),
reporter [ðŸ“„ Alessandra
Malito](https://www.marketwatch.com/author/alessandra-malito) recommends that we
do the following when choosing an investment advisor:

- Ask financial advisers for their credentials.
- Look up potential advisers and what their certifications mean as well as their
  backgrounds with tools like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's [ðŸ“„
  BrokerCheck](https://brokercheck.finra.org/), which shows any complaints and
  years of service for brokers and firms.
- Ask how much they get paid, how they get paid and what various fees mean.
- Know what investment products are being suggested or used, and how they are
  managed.
- Research advice, such as rolling over your assets from a 401(k) to an
  individual retirement account.


Another Alternative - Robo-Advisors

We learned in an earlier module that investment advisors include brokers (who
are not necessarily required to act in their client's best interests) and
fiduciaries (who are). There is now a third category of investment advisors, who
are not people at all. They're robots. Or at least "Robo-Advisors." Here's [ðŸ“„ a
description from Nerd
Wallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/best-robo-advisors/):

A robo-advisor is an online, automated portfolio management service. Because
these companies use computer algorithms -- a set of rules to choose appropriate
investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon -- they can offer
robo-advisor services for a fraction of the cost of a human financial advisor.
That lower-cost management, combined with features like automatic portfolio
rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting, can translate into higher net returns for
investors....

A robo-advisor is a good fit for you if you prefer to be largely hands-off with
your investments -- letting someone else do the work of building and optimizing
your portfolio -- and you don't have the kind of complex financial situation
that requires a direct relationship with a human financial advisor.

There are a number of robo-advisors available, both from large traditional
investing firms and also from new, smaller companies. Some organizations even
offer a combination of robo-advisors and human advisors. Visit the link below if
you'd like to see a list of recommended robo-advisors from Nerd Wallet.

### 15.5 More About Investing

At this point you might be interested in learning more about investing. Our BUSE
120 course just covers the basics about what investing is, the different types
of investments you can make, and how to do it. However, Miramar College offers
another course that covers investing in more detail. The course is BANK 103
Introduction to Investments. It presents some basic concepts such as investment
markets, transactions, planning, information, risk, and return. It also includes
information about various investment vehicles, including common stock,
fixed-income securities, derivative securities, and mutual funds. Please
consider enrolling in the course if you'd like to learn more.

In the meantime, we'll take a short quiz about investment fundamentals from the
[ðŸ“„ Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)](http://www.finra.org/).
The quiz covers many of the topics we've learned about during the last several
modules in this class. I think it's a good way to check your knowledge of basic
investing concepts. Please follow the link and take the quiz. When you're done,
click on the "Mark as Done" button on the top of the page and then return and
continue on to the "assignments" section of this module.
