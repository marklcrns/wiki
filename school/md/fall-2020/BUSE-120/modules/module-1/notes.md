## Chapter 1: Personal Financial Planning

### 1.1 Individual or "Micro" Factors That Affect Financial Thinking

Family Structure

- Marital status and dependents, such as children, parents, or siblings,
  determine whether you are planning only for yourself or for others as well.

Health

- Personal financial planning should include some protection against the risk of
  chronic illness, accident, or long-term disability and some provision for
  short-term events, such as pregnancy and birth.

Career Choice

- Your career choices affect your financial planning, especially through
  educational requirements, income potential, and characteristics of the
  occupation or profession you choose.

Age

- Needs, desires, values, and priorities all change over a lifetime, and
  financial concerns change accordingly. Analysis of **life stages** is part of
  financial planning.

As your career progresses, income increases but so does spending. Lifestyle
expectations increase. If you now have a spouse and dependents and elderly
parents to look after, you have additional needs to manage. In middle adulthood
you may also be acquiring more assets, such as a house, a retirement account, or
an inheritance.

As you age, you realize that you require more protection. You may want to stop
working one day, or you may suffer a decline in health.  As an older adult you
may want to create alternative sources of income, perhaps a retirement fund, as
insurance against a loss of employment or income.

Early and middle adulthood are periods of building up: building a family,
building a career, increasing earned income, and accumulating assets.

Later adulthood is a period of spending down. There is less reliance on earned
income and more on the accumulated wealth of assets and investments. You are
likely to be without dependents, as your children have grown up or your parents
passed on, and so without the responsibility of providing for them, your
expenses are lower.

|                   | Young Adulthood | Middle Adulthood | Older Adulthood   | Retirement |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Source of Income  | Wages           | Wages/Investment | Wages/ Investment | Investment |
| Asset Base        | None            | Accumulating     | Growing           | Using up   |
| Expenses          | Low             | Growing          | Growing           | Low        |
| Risk: Ability     | Low             | Higher           | Higher            | High       |
| Risk: Willingness | High            | Lower            | Lower             | Low        |

</center>

Typically, your ability to assume risk is high because of your accumulated
assets, but your willingness to assume risk is low, as you are now dependent on
those assets for income. As a result, risk tolerance decreases: you are less
concerned with increasing wealth than you are with protecting it.

### 1.2 Systemic or "Macro" Factors That Affect Financial Thinking

In the **capital market**, capital (cash or assets) is traded, most commonly in
the form of stocks and bonds (along with other ways to package capital). In
the **credit market**, a part of the capital market, capital is loaned and
borrowed rather than bought and sold.

Understanding large-scale economic patterns and factors that indicate the
health of an economy can help you make better financial decisions.

#### Business Cycles

An economy tends to be productive enough to provide for the wants of its
members. Normally, economic output increases as population increases or as
people's expectations grow. An economy's output or productivity is measured by
its **gross domestic product** or GDP, the value of what is produced in a
period. When the GDP is increasing, the economy is in an expansion, and when it
is decreasing, the economy is in a **contraction**. An economy that contracts
for half a year is said to be in recession; a prolonged recession is a
**depression**.

Over time, the economy tends to be cyclical, usually expanding but sometimes
contracting. This is called the **business cycle**. Periods of contraction are
generally seen as market corrections, or the market regaining its equilibrium,
after periods of growth.

While each cycle is born in a unique combination of circumstances, cycles occur
because things change and upset economic equilibrium. That is, events change
the balance between supply and demand in the economy overall. Sometimes demand
grows too fast and supply can't keep up, and sometimes supply grows too fast
for demand.

#### Employment Rate

An economy produces not just goods and services to satisfy its members but also
jobs, because most people participate in the market economy by trading their
labor, and most rely on wages as their primary source of income.

The **unemployment rate** is a measure of an economy's shortcomings, because it
shows the proportion of people who want to work but don't because the economy
cannot provide them jobs.

Unemployment also shows that the economy is not efficient, because it is not
able to put all its productive human resources to work.

The employment rate, or the participation rate of the labor force, shows how
successful an economy is at creating opportunities to sell labor and
efficiently using its human resources.

|                      | Boom               | Expansion            | Recession | Depression         |
|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Rate of GDP          | Unsustainably High | Positive             | Negative  | Unsustainably Low  |
| Rate of Unemployment | Unsustainably Low  | "Natural" or Minimal | Higher    | Unsustainably High |

</center>

**If there is too much demand for labor**-more jobs than workers to fill
them-then wages will rise, pushing up the cost of everything and causing prices
to rise. Prices usually rise faster than wages, for many reasons, which would
discourage consumption that would eventually discourage production and cause the
economy to slow down from its "boom" condition into a more manageable rate of
growth.

**If there is too little demand for labor**-more workers than jobs-then wages
will fall or, more typically, there will be people without jobs, or
unemployment. If wages become low enough, employers theoretically will be
encouraged to hire more labor, which would bring employment levels back up.

**If unemployment is high and prolonged**, then too many people are without
wages for too long, and they are not able to participate in the economy because
they have nothing to trade.

#### Currency Value

Stable currency value is another important indicator of a healthy economy and a
critical element in financial planning.

A currency's usefulness is based on what it can buy, or its **purchasing power**.
The more a currency can buy, the more useful and valuable it is.

When the value of a currency decreases, an economy has **inflation**. Its currency
has less value because it is less useful; that is, less can be bought with it.
Prices are rising. It takes more units of currency to buy the same amount of
goods. When the value of a currency increases, on the other hand, an economy has
**deflation**. Prices are falling; the currency is worth more and buys more.

Inflation is most commonly measured by the consumer price indexA measure of
inflation or deflation based on a national average of prices for a "basket" of
common goods and services purchased by the average consumer. (CPI), an index
created and tracked by the federal government.

**Currency instabilities can also affect investment values, because the dollars
that investments return don't have the same value as the dollars that the
investment was expected to return.**
