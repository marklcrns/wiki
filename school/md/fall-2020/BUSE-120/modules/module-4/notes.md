### 4.2 Time Value of Money (TVM)

**What is the Time Value of Money?**

The most important thing for you to learn from this module (and maybe from this
entire class) is the concept of the Time Value of Money (TVM). This concept
basically says that money is worth more to us the closer it is to us in time.
That's because the closer money is to us in time, the more liquid, or available
for our use, it is. For example, if you borrow $20 from me today and offer to
give me $25 when you see me next week, I might take you up on that offer because
I could use the extra $5 to buy a something for lunch. But if you borrow $20
from me today and offer to give me $25 a year from now, I probably won't take
you up on that offer. Why? Because the $25 isn't as valuable to me that far in
the future. For one thing, I'm not sure how much I will need it then. And for
another thing, I'm not totally sure that you'll remember to pay me. (Both of
those are "risks" I take if I agree to wait for a year before I'm paid). But
what if you offered to pay me $100 a year from now if I loaned you $20 today?
Then I would probably take you up on the offer because the large amount of money
that you promise to give me is worth the risk that you might not pay.

This relationship between time, money, and risk is what TVM is all about. As
time increases, liquidity goes down and risk goes up, therefore we demand more
money for our investment.

Below is a short video that explains this concept in a different way. Please
watch the video and then come back and continue reading the rest of this page.

**Calculating the Time Value of Money**

TVM can actually be calculated in real, dollar terms. In other words, we can
calculate how much $100 today would be worth a year from now. We can also
calculate how much $100 a year from now would be worth today. I think it's quite
interesting that TVM calculations let us go back and forward through time in
this way.

In order to make this kind of calculation, we need to know some important pieces
of information:

- Present Value (PV) is the value of the money in the present.
- Future Value (FV) is the value of the money in the future.
- Starting Principal is how much initial money is invested.
- Interest or Rate of Return (I/Y) is how much interest we're earning on the
  money during each period.

If you know any four of these four things, then you can calculate the other
missing one. Let's see how this works by watching the video below. When you're
done watching, please continue on to the next page in this module.

- [ðŸŽ¬ Time Value of Money - Macroeconomics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfkqCv3Rd_g)

$$
\text{Future Value of \$100 in } t \text{ years } = \$100(1 + r)^{t}
$$

Where $t$ is equal to number of years in the future and $r$ as the interest
rate in decimals.

$$
\text{Present Value of \$100 in } t \text{ years } = \frac{\$100}{(1 + r)^{t}}
$$

#### 4.2.1 The Power of Compound Interest

The main reason why time is so important in TVM calculations is because of
compound interest. Albert Einstein is credited as saying "compound interest is
the most powerful force in the universe." My roommates throughout college were
all physics majors so it was fun to tease them with this quote. But what does it
mean? Compound interest is a way to make your money grow exponentially faster by
letting the interest you earn continue to earn interest over time. It's a
powerful application of the time value of money.

#### 4.2.2 TVM Calculators

**Annuities**

Not only does the Time Value of Money (TVM) allow us to calculate values back
and forth through time, we can also calculate what happens if we make a series
of regular payments over time in addition to our original investment. This is
called an annuity. To calculate an annuity, we need the same information as we
used to calculate a future value or a present value, plus the amount of the
recurring payment:

- Present Value (PV) is the value of the money in the present.
- Future Value (FV) is the value of the money in the future.
- Starting Principal is how much initial money is invested.
- Interest or Rate of Return (I/Y) is how much interest we're earning on the
  money during each period.
- Payment or Annuity Payment (PMT) is how much more we're investing during each
  period.

Note: The period for the interest rate and the period for the payments must be
the same; so for example, if you're earning 6% per year in interest then you
would enter the payments made each year. The same example could also be
calculated using months by entering the payments made each month and using a
0.5% interest rate since 0.5% per month is the same as 6% per year divided by 12
months.

Just like in other kinds of TVM problems, if you know all but one of these
items, you can calculate the remaining item.

**Borrowing is the Inverse of Investing**

Incidentally, borrowing is the same thing as investing, only it's happening in
reverse. In other words, instead of renting your money to someone else and
earning interest, you are the one paying the interest to use someone else's
money. This can also be thought of as reducing the money you have in the future
in order to have more money in the present. That is:

- Investing is giving up some money today to have more in the future.
- Borrowing is giving up some money in the future to have more today.

> I've heard people say that this is one way we can "time travel" in real life -
by using TVM to move money to ourselves back and forth through time.

**The Finance Calculator**

The link below will bring you to a calculator that performs these calculations
for you. The calculator also provides some nice additional data, such as how
much of your money was actually invested (Total Principal) and how much of the
Future Value comes from interest. Please experiment by inputting some variables
and looking over the answers. For example, you might try to see how long it
would take you to save for a new car if you save/invest a certain amount per
month. The more familiar you become with this kind of calculation, the easier it
will be for you to make financial decisions about things like loans and
investments and the easier it will be for you to complete the exercise at the
end of this module.

**Other TVM Calculators**

I hope you got some good experience using the finance calculator.

There are many calculators similar to this one available for free on the web.
They can help you make all kinds of financial decisions, from investments to
loans to refinancing debt. The link below will bring you to some free
calculators available on the Smart About Money website, which is sponsored by
the National Endowment for Financial Education. Please follow the link and take
a look at any that interest you. A quick search of the Internet will bring up
many more.

### 4.3 Saving for College

**College Savings Accounts**

I hope this module has given you a new appreciation of the value of time and
interest in generating money from an investment. One way to take advantage of
both of these factors is to establish a college savings account. If you're
taking this class then you're already in college and so perhaps you won't be
saving for yourself. But you might want to save for your children, a spouse, or
perhaps for your own college expenses later in life. Some college savings
accounts allow your money to grow tax-free, which is essentially like adding
extra interest to your investment.

The link below will bring you to some information and resources on college savings provided by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Please read through the descriptions of each of the resources and click on at least one item that interests you to get more information about that topic. Once you've done that, click on the "Mark as Done" button on the top right-had corner of the page to indicate you've finished exploring the college savings information.

A Word About College Loans

College debt has become big news. Students nowadays are borrowing much more
money for college than they have in the past (Links to an external site.). And
when they graduate, many students find themselves in a large amount of debt at
the same time they're trying to start new careers. There are several reasons for
this:

- [ðŸŒŽ Overall, college has gotten more expensive](https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/average-rates-growth-published-charges-decade)
- [ðŸŒŽ Many states (like California) are devoting fewer resources to funding higher eduction](https://www.ppic.org/publication/higher-education-funding-in-california/)
- [ðŸŒŽ Colleges are adding more expensive services and amenities on campus in order to compete for students](https://www.usnews.com/news/college-of-tomorrow/articles/2014/09/22/how-do-schools-market-themselves-to-attract-students)
- [ðŸŒŽ Students are increasingly attending private colleges, including private for-profit colleges](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cha.asp)
- [â¬‡ Many students don't understand the impact of taking on college loans (some don't even know they are borrowing money)](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Are-College-Students-Borrowing-Blindly_Dec-2014.pdf)

Research seems to indicate that for the vast majority of students, it is not
cost effective to take on college debt in order to attend a more "prestigious"
college. This is because the expected increase in earnings is not worth the
added cost of the student loans to pay for the college. In fact,
[ðŸŒŽ research indicates that a student's major has a much bigger effect on earnings](https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/valueofcollegemajors/)
(at least earnings immediately after college graduation) than the choice of
college does.  (The only exception to this is very prestigious colleges that are
known around the world like Stanford or Harvard, in which case the increase in
expected earnings might possibly make up for the higher cost of attendance.) In
fact, I've heard research that indicates public-funded colleges like the
University of California (UC) or California State University (CSU) offer the
best "return on investment" for students.

### 4.4 Are You in a Financial Crisis?

Sometimes when they analyze their financial situation people find that they're
in a "financial crisis" or a situation where they just can't make ends meet. If
that's the case for you, it's important to come up with a plan to pay off your
bills in a logical progression and to work your way back to financial solvency.

Laura D. Adams has some suggestions for people who are in this situation. If
