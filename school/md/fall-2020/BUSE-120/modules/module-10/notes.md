# Module 10: Retirement and Estate Planning

## BUSE 120 Canvas Notes

### 10.2 Retirement Planning

#### Your Life Expectancy

In the reading for this module we learned that to estimate your required
retirement savings, you need to estimate your expenses in retirement, the
duration of your retirement, and the return on your savings in retirement. The
duration of your retirement is based on your life expectancy; that is, how long
you are likely to live. Of course, we don't really know how long we're going to
live, but it's really hard to do retirement planning without at least an
estimate.

The link below will bring you to a life expectancy calculator developed at the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. Please use the
calculator to estimate your life expectancy, write it down, and then return and
continue with this page. Note: You do not need to provide your email address to
get your life expectancy. Just close that window when you come to it and the
website will display your results.

#### Your Retirement Savings

Now that you know your life expectancy, you can calculate a rough estimate of
your retirement needs. The link below will bring you to a retirement calculator
provided by Calculator.net. Please input your own personal information into the
calculator to get an estimate of the savings you will need to fund your
retirement. After calculating that amount, experiment by changing some of the
parameters (such as the percentage of income required after retirement) to see
what happens with the result. When you're finished with the calculator, please
click on the "Mark as Done" button at the top of the page and then continue on.

Hopefully you found the information from the retirement calculator to be useful.
However, some people have trouble with estimating all the specific information
that goes into the calculator. This may be particularly true for students who
are not yet living on their own or settled in their career. If you fit this
category, here's a rule of thumb about saving for retirement:

- Save and invest 20% of your gross income for retirement if you want a better
  standard of living in retirement than you have now.
- Save and invest 15% of your gross income for retirement if you want about the
  same standard of living in retirement as you have now.
- Save and invest 10% (or less) of your gross income for retirement if you want
  a lower standard of living in retirement as you have now.

"Standard of living" means the amount of wealth you have available to spend on
your needs and wants. So if you want to live as comfortably in retirement as you
do now (or better), save and invest at least 15% of your gross income in a
retirement account.

#### What if You Can't Save That Much?

Sometimes when we calculate the savings required for our retirement, the result
can be a little overwhelming. This is especially true if you haven't ever
considered how much you need to save for retirement or if you're already past
the early parts of your life and haven't really started saving yet.

If you're in this category, Eric Tyson, MBA, author of "Personal Finance for
Dummies (Links to an external site.)" has some suggestion for how to make up for
lost time in retirement savings. They are:

- **Question your spending** - take a look at the items in the discretionary
  expenses portion of your budget and see what you can cut
- **Be more realistic about your retirement age** - the longer you work, the
  more time you have to save
- **Use your home equity** - in other words, plan to sell your home at
  retirement or take out a "reverse mortgage" to borrow against the value of the
  home
- **Get your investments growing** - by thoughtfully creating a portfolio of
  investments that earns good returns over time
- **Turn a hobby into supplemental retirement income**
- **Invest through a tax-sheltered retirement account** - this helps your
  investment grow quicker because the returns are not taxed

#### The Power of Time

In an earlier module we learned about the Time Value of Money (TVM) and how
powerful compound interest can be over time. Remember, compound interest means
that the meaning that the return your investment earns each year is added to
your principal, so that the balance of your investment doesn't just grow; it
grows at an increasing rate. The more time the investment has to grow, the more
it grows at an increasing rate.

This concept is particularly important when it comes to retirement savings
because ideally we save for retirement over a long period of time.

Take a look at the chart below from [ðŸŒŽ J.P. Morgan Asset
Management](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/gim/adv/home). In
particular, notice the three scenarios and how much of an impact time has on the
results in retirement.

Here are some interesting points to notice in the chart:

- Susan invests \$5,000 per year over 10 years only, for a total of \$50,000.
  Bill invests \$5,000 per year over 30 years, for a total of \$150,000 (three
  times as much as Susan!). But Susan ends up with more money in retirement than
  Bill. How can this be? It's because Susan invested earlier than Bill did. The
  power of compound interest over time made more of a difference than investing
  three times as much, but slightly later in life.
- Chris invests \$5,000 per year just like Susan. However, unlike Susan he keeps
  investing \$5,000 per year for the rest of his working life instead of
  stopping after just 10 years. As a result, Bill has well over a million
  dollars when he retires as opposed to Susan's \$602,070.
- Chris only invests \$50,000 more than Bill, yet in retirement he has \$602,000
  more than Bill does. Again, this huge difference is the result of two
  decisions: Chris started saving and investing for retirement earlier than
  Bill, and he kept doing it up until retirement age.

When people start investing for retirement they are often quite concerned about
things they can't control, such as the stock market or real estate prices. But
the truth is that we can control the thing that makes the most difference: time.
So start saving and investing for retirement as early as you can (that means now
if you have an income), even if you're only investing a small amount of money.
That small amount can grow into a large amount, because of the power of time and
the magic of compound interest.


### 10.3 Employer Retirement Accounts

In the reading for this chapter we learned about some kinds of
employer-sponsored retirement accounts. These are plans that employers can
establish for their employees to participate in. They offer tax advantages for
saving until retirement age. Because the returns on the money invested in these
accounts grows tax-free, they can generate much higher returns over time than a
regular taxable investment. There are more of these plans now than have existed
in the past. Each has different rules about how much money can be invested, the
age at which the money must be distributed (withdrawn), etc.

One important thing to be aware of in regards to employer-sponsored retirement
accounts is that many employers match the employee's contributions to their
employer-sponsored retirement account, up to a maximum level. For example, if
you contribute \$100 per month to your 401k or other employer-sponsored
retirement account, your employer will also contribute an additional \$100 per
month to your account. But if you don't contribute anything, then your employer
won't either. In other words, your investment doubles in value immediately
because your employer matches whatever you put in. Employers that do this
usually have a maximum limit to their match, which is sometimes a dollar amount
and sometimes a percentage of your gross salary. Also, some employers don't
match the funds but rather contribute a percentage of what you contribute. So
for example if you contribute \$100 an employer might contribute 50% of that, or
\$50. No matter how much the employer contributes, however, it's free money to
you so if you're in this kind of work situation you should always contribute to
your employer-sponsored retirement account, at least up to the maximum amount
that your employer will contribute.

The link below will bring you to a chart showing the major differences among the
various employer-sponsored retirement accounts. Please feel free to download and
keep the chart, but be aware that some of the information may change because the
tax code changes each year. After you're done, please return and continue on to
the next page in this module.

### 10.4 Individual Retirement Accounts

In addition to employer-sponsored retirement accounts, the reading for this
module briefly covered individual retirement accounts (IRAs). These are
retirement accounts that you set up and contribute to as an individual (not
through your employer). Like employer-sponsored retirement accounts, they allow
your investment to grow tax-free.

There are two types of IRAs: "Traditional" IRAs and "Roth" IRAs. The biggest
difference between the two is: You don't pay taxes on money you contribute to a
Traditional IRA, but you do pay taxes on the distributions (withdrawals in
retirement) from a Traditional IRA. In contrast, you do pay taxes on money you
contribute to a Roth IRA, but you do not pay taxes on the distributions from a
Roth IRA. There are other differences as well, such as the mandatory
distribution age.

The link below will bring you to a chart showing the major differences between
these two kinds of IRAs. Please feel free to download and keep the chart, but be
aware that some of the information may change because the tax code changes each
year. After you're done, please return and continue on to the next page in this
module.

### 10.5 Social Security and Other Retirement Info

In the reading for this module we learned a little about Social Security, which can be thought of as the federal government's retirement plan for individuals. You can get personalized information about your own expected Social Security benefits as well as other information about saving and investing for retirement at the links below:

### 10.6 Wills vs. Living Trusts

In the reading for this module we learned about the basics of wills and trusts.
The most basic decision you have to make about this is whether you need a will
or a living trust. The short video below explains the basic difference between
the two. (Feel free to skip over the part at the end about the services offered
by LegalZoom). When you're finished viewing the video, please continue on to the
next page in this module.

### 10.7 Finances and Aging

The last topic I'd like to touch on in this module is the importance of financial planning as we age. As people get older, their cognitive and decision-making abilities often decline, making it harder for them to make sound financial decisions and to manage their own finances. This is known as "diminished financial capacity." It's important to recognize the signs of this in our loved ones that we may need to care for, such as parents or guardians. It's also important to prepare for this possibility in our own lives.

The links below will bring you to some additional information about managing someone else's finances if they have experienced diminished financial capacity as well as managing your own finances in a caregiver role. Please look over the links, copy or write down any information that would be helpful for you, and then continue on to the "activities" portion of this module.

  * Tips from Smart About Money to manage your own finances if you find yourself
    in a caregiver role; something that you may have already experienced or will
    experience in the future if you have to provide care for a loved one.
