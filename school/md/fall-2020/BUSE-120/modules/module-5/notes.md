## Web Notes

### 5.2 Budgeting Basics

The Budgeting Process

In the reading for this module we learned about the five-step budgeting process.
This is a recurring process of defining your goals and gathering data, forming
expectations about your budget, creating the budget, monitoring the outcomes and
analyzing the variances, and adjusting the budget, expectations, or goals before
starting again. In the earlier modules we gathered data and started to form some
expectations about our budget. In this module we will actually create a
one-month budget. Then in a later module we will monitor the outcomes of our
budget and analyze the variances. After that you can continue on by adjusting
your budget and starting over again.

I update my own budget once a year using this process, and I think it works
well. However, it's a little academic and it probably doesn't feel natural or
comfortable for everyone. Another way to think about the process is to follow
some sequential steps instead of a cycle.

[ðŸŒŽ The Smart About Money (SAM) website](https://www.smartaboutmoney.org/),
sponsored by the [ðŸŒŽ National Endowment for Financial Education](https://www.nefe.org/)
is a good place to learn more about this approach to managing your money. Please

#### Things to Avoid in Budgeting

In the reading for this module we learned that it's important to "budget
conservatively," which means to err on the side of underestimating our income
and err on the side of overestimating our expenses. This is a fine academic
definition, but what does it actually mean in practice? The video below
describes some mistakes that people often make when first making a budget (and
how to make sure you don't make these mistakes). I think it's a good
introduction to some important budgeting concepts. Please watch the video and
then continue reading the rest of this page.

#### Updating Your Budget

In the activities section of this module you will create an initial monthly
budget. Budgets can be created and updated for different amounts of time -
monthly, quarterly (which is every three months), or yearly are the most common.
Most experts recommend that we review and update our budget at least annually,
and that we track our actual numbers more often than that. I personally update
my budget, along with my other personal financial statements, every year and I
track the budget numbers every quarter.

In addition to updating the budget and other financial statements, some experts
suggest we do a sort of "periodic financial checkup" on ourselves every year or
so. This consists of taking care of all of our periodic financial needs and
tasks in addition to updating the statements. The link below will bring you to
an article and podcast by Laura D. Adams about taking a "personal financial day"
every year to update your financial statements and also review important
financial documents and services. Please view the link if you're interested and
then move on to the next page in this module.

### 5.3 Windfalls and Budgeting

A "windfall" is a one-time sum of money (or some other good fortune) that you
receive, or might receive. Sometimes in life this comes to us in the form of an
inheritance, a bonus at work, or even a gift. Windfalls are good things, of
course, but it's quite easy to slip into the habit of either depending on
receiving them or spending them in a thoughtless way and then regretting it
later.

It's important to remember that the windfall is not a recurring source of
income. It's very easy to count on a windfall to balance our budget. We then get
used to spending both our regular income and the windfall we've received. But
when the windfall money is used up it's much harder to go back to our former
spending habits; we've become used to having the extra income. It's not that
spending the windfall is bad; it may in fact be the best way to use the money if
it adds the most to your life. But we shouldn't get used to that level of
spending because the windfall is a one-time event. And we especially shouldn't
rely on the windfall to fund our living expenses, because we might not receive
the windfall in the future. For example, it's a bad idea to rely on a bonus from
work to fund our living expenses because we might not actually receive a bonus -
it's not a dependable source of income.

Another thing to consider when you receive a windfall is the time value of money
(TVM). Spending the windfall now may increase your enjoyment in the present but
it takes away from your potential enjoyment in the future. Instead, using the
windfall to add to your savings/investments is often a better strategy.

The short video below provides some suggestions on smart ways to spend a
windfall. Please watch the video and then continue on to the next page in the
module.

### 5.4 Ways to Reduce Spending

Welcome back. I hope you found the video to be a good, quick illustration of how
powerful time is in saving and earning money, especially from something
unexpected like a windfall.

As we read in the textbook chapter for this module, the last part of the
budgeting process is about adjusting our expectations and goals and then
starting the process over again. Adjusting expectations and goals can sometimes
mean that our budget is not balanced, and so we need to increase our income or
reduce our expenses (it can mean the opposite too, of course). It's often easier
to reduce expenses than to increase income, so that's an area that is usually
fruitful to explore. You'll have a chance to practice this with your own budget
when you complete the Personal Budget Project later in the course.

For now, though, let's look at a few common ways to reduce spending in order to
balance our budget. The following is a partial list of spending reduction ideas
from Eric Tyson, MBA, author of "Personal Finance for Dummies." Notice that he
starts with housing and transportation costs, since those are often the largest
expense in a personal budget.

Reducing rental costs

- Move to a lower-cost rental
- Share a rental
- Negotiate your rental increases
- Buy rather than rent

Reducing homeowner costs

- Know what you can afford
- Rent out a room
- Refinance your mortgage
- Appeal your property tax assessment
- Reduce utility costs

Reducing transportation costs

- Research before you buy a car
- Buy your car with cash (especially a used car)
- Replace high-cost cars
- Keep cars to a minimum
- Buy commuter passes
- Use regular unleaded gas
- Service your car regularly

Reducing phone bills

- Explore family plan options
- Explore prepaid or no-contract plans

Other potential savings

- Use low-cost hairstylists
- Take lower-cost vacations
- Avoid buying health club memberships (but don't avoid exercising!)
- Stop smoking, gambling, or abusing alcohol or drugs (these are unhealthy as
  well as expensive)

You could probably add more ideas to this list with a few minutes of reflection.
The point is that there are usually ways to balance a budget, even ways that do
not affect your overall lifestyle. But we typically don't consider them unless
we go through the process of making and analyzing a budget.

### 5.5 How do Millionaires Do It?

I used to think of millionaires as people who either inherited a lot of money or
earned a lot of money through some high-paying job. My assumption was that in
order to have a lot of money you had to earn a lot of money. But research tells
us tells us that this is not necessarily the case. Instead, in order to have a
lot of money you really have to save a lot of money. In fact, many people who
earn a lot of money are actually deeply in debt because of trying to fund a
lavish lifestyle or other financial management problems. In other words, it's
not what you earn but what you save.

According to a PNC Wealth Management 2013 survey of millionaires (adults with at
least $1 million in investments) as reported in Money magazine, these are the
things that actually accounted for the millionaires success in becoming wealthy:

- 56% said saving early and regularly
- 38% said controlling spending
- 38% said smart investment choices
- 26% said earning a lot of money.

I think it's very interesting that more than twice as many millionaires cited
saving as more important than earning. If you're interested in learning more
about real millionaires (as opposed to our often incorrect assumptions), you
might enjoy reading The
[ðŸŒŽ Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko](https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1485268858&sr=1-1&keywords=the+millionaire+next+door).
It's a research-based book about the characteristics and behaviors that helped
millionaires achieve their wealth. I found it really eye-opening.

Another guideline I've read about is the 50-30-20 rule. This rule says that when
making a budget you should plan to spend 50% of your income on living expenses
(your "needs"), no more than 30% on discretionary expenses (your "wants"), and
at least 20% on savings/investments. You might try keeping that rule in mind
when creating your own budget at the end of this module.
