# Module 9: Insurance

## BUSE 120 Canvas Notes

### 9.2 What Insurance Do You Need?

The most fundamental thing to understand about insurance is that its purpose is
to avoid the risk of catastrophic loss. In other words, it's intended to keep
you from losing everything in the event of a significant unfortunate event; not
to cover every small loss you might incur. I think it's important to keep this
principle in mind when making decisions about insurance because it can 1) help
keep you from buying insurance you don't need, 2) help you to identify the
insurance that you do need, and 3) keep you from making spurious claims on your
insurance, which can have negative effects on your future.

What insurance should you buy? Our textbook covers three basic types of
insurance: Property insurance, health insurance, and disability/life insurance.
These three provide protection against catastrophic loss of property, health,
and income. When deciding what insurance to buy, consider these factors:

**Property insurance**

- Do you own a car?
- Do you own a home?
- Do you have tangible assets that could be lost due to fire, theft, or other cause?
- Do you have financial assets that could be lost if someone sues you?

**Health insurance**

Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), all Americans are now required to have
health insurance. If you don't already have it through your employer or through
other means, you should look into buying your own insurance. You can visit the
link below to learn more about individual coverage.

**Life and disability insurance**

- Are you single without children?
- Are you part of a working couple, and each partner's income could support both of you?
- Are you independently wealthy and don't need to work?
- Are you retired and living off your capital?

If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, then you probably do not need
life insurance. Why not? Because no one else is relying on your income, so in
the event of your death no one would be disadvantaged. However, if someone is
dependent on your income or is likely to become dependent in the future, then
you should probably look into buying life insurance.

If you answered "yes" to the first of these questions but "no" to the rest of
them, then you probably need disability insurance. This provides income for you
or your family if you become unable to work due to an accident or illness.
According to the Social Security Administration, [ðŸ“„ about 25% of people in
their 20's will become disabled before they
retire](http://www.disabilitycanhappen.org/chances_disability/disability_stats.asp)
(a much higher number than those who will die before retirement). Many people
are eligible for disability insurance through their employer.

information on this page and be sure to click on the link at the bottom that

### 9.3 Car Insurance

In the reading for this module we learned about the different basic categories
of car insurance. Terms used in car insurance can be confusing since they depend
on what damage has happened and by whom. The video below explains these terms
and some reasons why you might want or not want certain types of auto insurance.

### 9.4 Health Insurance

#### The Affordable Care Act (ACA)

I hope you've enjoyed using our Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook. The
major advantage of this textbook is that it is totally free for anyone to use. A
major disadvantage is that it is not updated regularly (at least the totally
free edition is not). One example is that the textbook was written before the
Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, went into effect, so this
item is not covered by the textbook.

The ACA includes a number of different components that affect individuals,
employers, health care providers, public programs, and other groups. The most
important aspect of the law for purposes of this class is that individuals are
required to have health insurance. If you don't have health insurance, or if
you're thinking of changing the insurance you have, please consider visiting [ðŸ“„
www.healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) to learn more about your
options.

#### Health Insurance Terms and Quiz

The terms used in the field of health insurance can be very confusing. Many of
us don't really pay attention to them until we actually need health care, and
then we're often not in good enough shape to truly understand them. The links
below will bring you to a glossary of health care terms and an online quiz about
health insurance from the [ðŸ“„ Henry J. Kaiser Foundation](https://www.kff.org/).
Please complete the quiz to learn more about your understanding of health care
terms. You can use the glossary link as a reference while working on the quiz.
Once you're finished please return and continue with this page.

#### Healthy Lifestyle Choices

Regardless of the kind of health insurance we have, experiencing health problems
is one of the surest ways to harm you financially and of course in almost every
other area of your life. In fact, most of the advice and information in this
course won't do you much good if you are not feeling well and healthy in your
life. For example, regardless of how much retirement savings you have, you're
unlikely to fully enjoy it if you have significant health problems.

Some kinds of illness and injury are totally unavoidable or due to chance. But
many are not. I think the best (and least expensive) kind of health insurance to
have is a healthy lifestyle. From a personal finance perspective, living a
healthy life is likely to pay off for you financially in the long run more than
earning more income will, because a healthy lifestyle can reduce your expenses
significantly by helping you to save on health insurance and out-of-pocket
medical costs, as well as spending on unhealthy practices like smoking or
illegal drug use.

The first link below will bring you to a "Healthy Lifestyle Test" from
Psychology Today. Please take the test and then review your results. After
taking the test, click on the second link to visit the U.S. Health and Human
Services Prevention and Wellness website. At that website, use the links to find
more information about at least one aspect of health that you could improve in
your own day-to-day life. After you're done, please click on the "Mark as Done"
button at the top of the page to indicate you have completed the quiz and
visited the HHS website.

### 9.5 Life Insurance

As a reminder, life insurance is used when someone is dependent on your income
or is likely to become dependent in the future. For example, if you have a child
who is dependent on your income you may want to buy life insurance to ensure
that, in the event of your death, your child has sufficient money to live on
until they become a self-dependent adult.

In the reading for this module we learned about the difference between term and
whole life insurance. Essentially, term life insurance is just insurance that
lasts for a specific period of time (the term) and then ends. Whole life
insurance is life insurance combined with an investment that lasts for one's
whole life - it's sort of two different things wrapped up in one. The other
difference is that whole life insurance is usually much more expensive than term
life insurance - often up to 800% more. Whole life is also usually marketed much
more heavily than term life by insurance salespeople, because they can earn a
large commission when they sell this kind of insurance.

There are advantages and disadvantages to buying each of these kinds of life
insurance policies. Most financial advice that I've read says that term life
insurance is a better value. However, some people may benefit more from whole
life insurance. The link below will bring you to a Consumer Reports (Links to an
external site.) article describing the difference between these two kinds of
life insurance. I think Consumer Reports is a trustworthy source of information
on this topic because they are a nonprofit organization that advocates for
consumers and does not take money from companies for advertising or other
purposes. Please read through the article and then click on the "Mark as Done"
button at the top of the page to indicate that you've finished it.
