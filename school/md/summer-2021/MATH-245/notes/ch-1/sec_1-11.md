# Section 1.11: The Scales of Notation

1. If m and n are positive integers and n > 1, then m can be represented in
   terms of n in one and in only one way in the form
   $$
   m = a_{0}n^{h} + a_{1}n^{h - 1} + \cdots + a_{h - 1}n + a_{h},
   $$
   
   where

   $$
   a_{0} \neq 0, 0 \le a_{i} < n, \;\;\; i = 0,1,2,\cdots, h.
   $$
2. Any positive integer can be represented in one and in only one way as a sum
   of different powers of 2.
