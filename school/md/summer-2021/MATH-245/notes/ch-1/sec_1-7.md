# Section 1.7: The Unique Factorization Theorem

1. Every integer greater than unity can be represented in one and in only one
   way as a product of prime numbers.
2. Every non-unit positive integer m can be represented in one and in only one
   way in the form
   $$
   m = p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}p_{2}^{\alpha_{2}} \cdots p_{n}^{\alpha_{n}}
   $$
   where $p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n$ are different primes and $\alpha_{1},
   \alpha_{2}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}$ are positive integers.


- COROLLARY 1: If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime integers and $c$ is divisible
by both $a$ and $b$, then $c$ is divisible by $ab$.

- COROLLARY 2: If $a$ and $b$ are each prime to $c$ then $ab$ is prime to $c$.

- COROLLARY 3: If $a$ is prime to $c$ and $ab$ is divisible by $c$, then $b$ is
divisible by $c$.
