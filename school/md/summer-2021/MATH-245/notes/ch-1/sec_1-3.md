# Section 1.3: Prime Numbers. The Sieve of Eratosthenes

- _DEFINITION_: If an integer $p$ is different from 1 and has no divisor except
itself and 1 it is said to be a prime number or to be a prime.

- _DEFINITION_: An integer which has at least one divisor other than itself and
1 is said to be a composite number or to be composite.

All integers are thus divided into three classes: **The unit**, **Prime
numbers**, and **Composite numbers**.

## Theorems

1. Every integer greater than 1 has a prime factor.
2. An integer $m$ is prime if it has no prime factor equal or less than $I$,
   where $I$ is the greatest integer whose square is equal to or less than $m$.
