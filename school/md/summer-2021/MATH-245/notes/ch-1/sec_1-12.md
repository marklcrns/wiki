# Section 1.12: Highest Power of a Prime p Contained in n!

1. The index of the highest power of a prime $p$ contained in n! is
   $$
   \left [ \frac{n}{p} \right ] + \left [ \frac{n}{p^{2}} \right ] + \left [ \frac{n}{p^{3}} \right ] + \cdots
   $$
2. If $n$ is represented in the scale of $p$ in the form
   $$
   n = a_{0}p^{h} + a_{1}p^{h - 1} + \cdots + a_{h},
   $$
3. If $n, \alpha, \beta, \cdots, \lambda$ are any positive integers such that $n
   = \alpha + \beta + \cdots + \lambda$, then
   $$
   \frac{n!}{\alpha!\beta!\cdots\lambda!}
   $$
   if an integer.
