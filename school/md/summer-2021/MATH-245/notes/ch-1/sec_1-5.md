# Section 1.5: The Fundamental Theorem of Euclid

If $a$ and $b$ are any two positive integers there exist integers $q$ and $r$,
$q \ge 0$, $0 \le r < b$, such that

$$
a = qb + r
$$

If $a$ is a multiple of $b$ the theorem is at once verified, $r$ being in this
case 0. If $a$ is not a multiple of $b$ it must lie between two consecutive
multiples of $b$; that is, there exists a q such that

$$
qb < a < (q + 1)b
$$

Hence there is an integer $r$, $0 < r < b$, such that $a = qb + r$. In case $b$
is greater than $a$ it is evident that $q = 0$ and $r = a$. Thus the proof of
the theorem is complete.
