# Section 1.6: Divisibility by a Prime Number

1. If $p$ is a prime number and $m$ is any integer, then $m$ either is divisible
   by $p$ or is prime to $p$.
2. The product of two integers each less than a given prime number $p$ is not
   divisible by $p$.
3. If neither of two integers is divisible by a given prime number $p$ their
   product is not divisible by $p$.
4. If no one of several integers is divisible by a given prime $p$ their product
   is not divisible by $p$.
