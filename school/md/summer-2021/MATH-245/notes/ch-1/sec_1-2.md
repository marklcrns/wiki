# Section 1.2: Definition of Divisibility. The Unit

## Theorems

> NOTE: $a|b$ reads as $a$ is divisible by/a divisor of $b$

1. If $b|a$ and $c|b$, then $c|a$. Since $b|a$ there exists an integer $\beta$
   such that $a = b\beta$. Since $c|b$ there exists an integer $\gamma$ such
   that $b = c\gamma$. Substituting this value of $b$ in the equation $a
   = b\gamma$ we have $a = c\gamma\beta$. But from theorem III of section 1.1 it
   follows that $\gamma\beta$ is an integer; hence, $c|a$, as was to be proved.
2. If $c$ is a divisor of both $a$ and $b$, then $c|(a + b)$. From the
   hypothesis of the theorem it follows that integers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ exist
   such that $a = c\alpha$, $b = c\beta$.
3. If $c$ is a divisor of both $a$ and $b$, then $c|(a - b)$.

The proof is analogous to that of the preceding theorem.

- If $a$ and $b$ are both divisible by $c$, then $c$ is said to be a common
divisor or a common factor of $a$ and $b$. Every two integers have the common
factor 1. The greatest integer which divides both $a$ and $b$ is called the
greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$. More generally, we define in a similar
way a common divisor and the greatest common divisor of $n$ integers $a_1 , a_2
, \cdots , a_n$.

- _DEFINITION_: If an integer a is a multiple of each of two or more integers it
is called a common multiple of these integers. The product of any set of
integers is a common multiple of the set. The least integer which is a multiple
of each of two or more integers is called their least common multiple. It is
evident that the integer 1 is a divisor of every integer and that it is the only
integer which has this property. It is called the **unit**.

- _DEFINITION_: Two or more integers which have no common factor except 1 are
said to be prime to each other or to be relatively prime.

- _DEFINITION_: If a set of integers is such that no two of them have a common
divisor besides 1 they are said to be prime each to each.
