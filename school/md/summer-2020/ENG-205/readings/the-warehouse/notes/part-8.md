# Part 8: Prep

## Gibson Wells

  - As he continues his blog, Wells told a story about Lazarus and the rich man
    from the bible and posed a question as to why the rich people always gets a
    bad rap for being rich. Assuming all rich people will go to hell and the
    poor people are treated as a virtue. He also argues that the way people get
    rich matters and what the poor people did to deserve such a fate.
  - "The market dictates" (262). He told a story about how he wanted to give
    people cheaper product by working with companies to make their product
    cheaper. Wells was always firm with his decision for wanting a cheaper
    price, too cheap for the companies he works with. So whenever they do not
    meet to a resolution, Wells pulls the plug and produce his own product
    priced exactly as he wanted that would render all competitions out of
    business.
  - Was he wrong for doing this? He wants whats best for the people in general,
    in their deteriorating planet. He was not driven by greed and seem to be
    true to his words that he wants to have a better world for everyone.
