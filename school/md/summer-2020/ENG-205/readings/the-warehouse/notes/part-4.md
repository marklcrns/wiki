# Part 4: Cut Day

## Gibson Wells

  - Visiting MotherClouds with his driver Jerry, thinking about all the final
    things he could experience before he die, somber.
  - While visiting one of the first MotherCloud ever built in Pennsylvania, he
    met Tom Dooley who was a senior pickers. Heard his inspiring story and were
    so grateful of the MotherCloud of the good paying job it gave him and his
    wife.
  - Wells mentioned in his blog that he well be naming his successor soon.
  - Mentioned his dream that one day people will be able to go outside free of
    greenhouse gasses suffocating their planet, making the world a better place,
    giving people jobs, as speaks about his successor, her daughter Claire.
    * He also mentioned asking Ray to stay as VP and COO of the company, and
      waiting for his response.


## Zinnia

  - As she stumbled upon a damaged good in her shift, she went to a manager
    which the watch led him to her Point Manager, Rick.
  - On her way to her dorm, she witnessed Bill, A.K.A Dollar Bill, who was
    turfed during Cut Day. Then she went to Cynthia, her disabled neighbor, and
    gossiped about her encounter with Rick. Cynthia knew him and just told her
    to deal with it but Zinnia didn't like what she said.
  - She finished cutting the rectangular whole in her ceiling covered by a
    tapestry, then jumped in to continue her mission.
  - While everyone is distracted from the cut day commotion, she took advantage
    of it and successfully found her way into a CloudPoint (sort of control
    panel) and inserted the gopher hacking device.


## Rick

  - Zinnia's new Point Manager who sexually harassed her in the
    gender-neutral bathroom.
  - Was notoriously know as a creep who never get punished, probably he has some
    connections with the upper management.


## Paxton

  - After his shift from his new scanner duty assignment, he went onto the
    Live-play where he saw Dakota running towards her and told him to go with
    her to the tram because its cut day.
  - He saw people don't want to leave lying on the floor refusing to get into
    tram. He also saw Dollar bill jumped off the tracks of the tram, dead.
  - He was distraught after experiencing his terrible first cut day, especially
    after the code J incident (jumper).
  - Had another drinks with Zinnia and asked her about seeing her earlier that
    she might know something about the door of the CloudPoint panel swung open.
    Paxton was depressed with his day then Zinnia took him to her apartment and
    got laid.
  - The day after the night with Zinnia, he had an idea about signal drops and
    ran it through Dakota. Then it got to Dobbs which was pleased by his idea
    and took him back from scanner duty to task force once again.
