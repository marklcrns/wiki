# Part 10: The Man

## Paxton

  - Zinnia was taken down to the investigation room with Dobbs. Paxton was
    confused on what is going on. Dakota is suspecting him as an accomplice. But
    is trying to tell him to cooperate so he doesn't get into trouble, to stop
    protecting her and give out information.
  - As he left the interrogation room, his hands on his chest as if it was about
    to burst, he went inside another empty interrogation room then Gibson Wells
    followed him inside closing the doors shut.
  - Gibson Wells explained everything to him about the why Zinnia was hired and
    what she's after. As if it was a bribe, he wants Paxton to shut his mouth
    off this and in return a comfortable life in the Cloud.
  - He went back to his room and before going back, he remembered to stop by
    Hadley's room to check her, in which he found dead overdosed from oblivion
    Zinnia gave her.


## Zinnia

  - Had a conversation with Paxton in the investigation room but she wouldn't
    tell him about what really happened. She tries to convince Paxton what
    really was going on in the Cloud and how things are running. Telling a story
    from a book that Ember mentioned, "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas."
    Explaining to him that for billions of people to live a great life, one kid
    needs to be sacrificed in a dark room behind bars, neglected, innocent.
  - Gibson Wells went ahead to talk to Zinnia, still in the investigation room,
    people are watching but cannot hear their conversation. Zinnia figured out
    that Wells was the one who hired her and gave the order to kill him. Wells
    explained how about the cold fusion that powers the entire MotherCloud
    behind those refrigerator like box she saw from the energy process facility
    that Wells rivals so desired. Additionally, Wells told of the story of a
    young elephant tied in a tree, growing up and getting bigger each day
    unaware of its ability to break free (analogous to the CloudBand).
