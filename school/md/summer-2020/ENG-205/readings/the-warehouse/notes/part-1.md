# Part 1: Processing

Gibson Wells

  - Dying within a year.
    * Stage-four pancreatic cancer. Final stage.
  - Very wealthy.
  - Owner of the Cloud/MotherCloud: Successful business store.
  - Wants to tell his story through writhing. Blogging about his life, since he
    has no to time left to write a book.
  - Achieved many life goals.
  - Good moral compass.
  - Compassionate.
  - Wife named Molly and a daughter named Claire.
  - Used to run little errands for other neighbors picking up groceries for some
    change when he was a kid. Became a small side hustle with friends working
    for him.
    * This is where he got the idea for starting the Cloud company.


The Cloud/MotherCloud

  - A massive business like Amazon
  - Biggest electronic retail and cloud computing company in the world.


Paxton

  - On a bus ride to his a job processing at the Cloud in a scorching hot sunny
    day seeing through the window from the inside of the bus a used-to-be busy
    city bustling with people that now seems to be a laborious broken town.
  - Had a running business of convenient gadgets like "the Perfect Boiled Egg"
  - Used to be a security guard at a prison.
  - Used to work with the Cloud with contempt towards the company as he left his
    business, claiming that it destroyed his life.
    * Maybe cloud isn't as great as what Gibson Wells thought it is from his
      view? Successful company with shark-like appetite for competition.
    * Used to be a **CEO**
    * Why is he applying a job at the Cloud if he thinks it destroyed his life.
    * Could the broken town forced him enough to swallow his pride and apply for
      the company who exploited his business?
    * He passed the screening test and end up being a security guard that he
      really hates.
  - Starting to develop a liking for Zinnia.


Zinnia

  - One of the applicants who passed the screening test at the Cloud.
  - Used to be math teacher who were layed off because of job reduction.
  - The women 8 seats across from Paxton whom she called the "goof" who now is
    seating besides her on the Cloud bus.
  - Heard from the woman in lavender pantsuit who also an applicant at the Cloud
    that the test was simple: answering too quick, means you are powering
    through, waiting too long, and your relationship to reason was wanting. The
    video recording was review was automated by keywords and eye-contacts.
  - Seems to be hiding something. Always keeping a low-profile and avoiding
    standing out. Picks different name every other jobs.
