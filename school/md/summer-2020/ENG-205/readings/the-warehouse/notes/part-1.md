## Paxton

  - On a bus ride to his a job processing at the Cloud in a scorching hot sunny
    day seeing through the window from the inside of the bus a used-to-be busy
    city bustling with people that now seems to be a laborious broken town.
  - Had a running business of convenient gadgets like "the Perfect Boiled Egg"
  - Used to be a security guard at a prison.
  - Used to work with the Cloud with contempt towards the company as he left his
    business, claiming that it destroyed his life.
    * Maybe cloud isn't as great as what Gibson Wells thought it is from his
      view? Successful company with shark-like appetite for competition.
    * Used to be a **CEO**
    * Why is he applying a job at the Cloud if he thinks it destroyed his life.
    * Could the broken town forced him enough to swallow his pride and apply for
      the company who exploited his business?
    * He passed the screening test and end up being a security guard that he
      really hates.
  - Starting to develop a liking for Zinnia.


## Zinnia

  - One of the applicants who passed the screening test at the Cloud.
  - Used to be math teacher who were layed off because of job reduction.
  - The women 8 seats across from Paxton whom she called the "goof" who now is
    seating besides her on the Cloud bus.
  - Heard from the woman in lavender pantsuit who also an applicant at the Cloud
    that the test was simple: answering too quick, means you are powering
    through, waiting too long, and your relationship to reason was wanting. The
    video recording was review was automated by keywords and eye-contacts.
  - Seems to be hiding something. Always keeping a low-profile and avoiding
    standing out. Picks different name every other jobs.
    * Aims to be a part of the tech crew but got a different job.
    * Experienced at penetrating security systems and reconnaissance.
