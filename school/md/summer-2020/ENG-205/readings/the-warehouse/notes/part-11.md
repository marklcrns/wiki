## Paxton

  - Found out the whole truth about the task force. Dobbs weren't trying to get
    rid of the Oblivion, they were trying to replace it with their own product.
  - He continues on his boring life doing the same thing over and over until he
    got the message that his patent approval on Perfect Egg that he waited for
    so long were denied for another patent similar to his already exist.
    CloudEgg.
  - One day while delivering a package in the waste processing, he saw Rick, the
    former point manager of Zinnia who sexually harassed harmless women who was
    supposed to be fired, still working at the Cloud in green shirt. He charged
    in Dobbs office and rant about it but end up just walking away heads down,
    looking for Dakota for another of the Oblivion 2.0 they've been pushing.
  - Paxton saw Ember trying to infiltrate the MotherCloud, took her in one of
    the investigation room and gave Ember the USB drive he kept from their first
    encounter outside of the Cloud. The drive is a virus that will fire
    thrusters on the Cloud satellite and will make it crash in a few weeks. It
    will not end the Cloud but it will cripple it for a long time.
  - From this day, Paxton decided to help Ember, hearing the voice of Zinnia in
    his head, to revolt against the Cloud.
