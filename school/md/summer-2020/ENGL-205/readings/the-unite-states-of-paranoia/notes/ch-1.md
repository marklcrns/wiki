# Chapter 1: The Paranoid Style is American Politics

Andrew Jackson - January 30, 1835

  - Failed assassination by Richard Lawrence (aka King Richard III).
  - Pistol misfired, second weapon failed too.
  - Assumed that Poindexter hired Lawrence to assassinate him.
  - Some of Jackson's critics suggest that he had staged the assault to gain
    public support, which explained why both weapons failed.


George Poindexter

  - Noisy opponent of Jackson administration
  - Claiming to have seen with Richard Lawrence before the assassination of
    Jackson.
  - Accused of plotting the assignation of president Jackson.


John Calhoun

  - South Carolina senator and former vice president
  - Some Jacksonian pointed fingers at Calhoun, he argues if "he had not been
    directly involved in the assassination attempt, he had at the very least
    incited it with a speech denouncing Jackson as an American Caesar" (p. 4).


John Smith Dye

  - Described the Jacksonian assassination 29 years later.
  - Thought Calhoun was involved in to a larger force, Slave Power,that would
    have benefited if Jackson died.
  - Reported Slave Power was more than willing to kill a powerful man to get its
    way.
  - "President William Henry Harrison told Calhoun he wasn't sure he was willing
    to annex Texas, which southerners wanted to add to the union as a slave
    state.  **Harrison promptly died**." (p. 4). Dye was sure the cause of death
    was arsenic instead of the reported pneumonia.
  - "President Zachary Taylor opposed the Slave Power's agenda in Cuba and the
    Southwest, and so he was killed by the same poison." (p. 4).
  - "President-elect James Buchanan prepared to make some appointments of which
    the slaveocrats disapproved, Dye declared, he narrowly survived one of the
    most elaborate assassination plots ever conceived." (pp. 4-5).
  - "On February 23, 1857, according to Dye, southern agents poisoned all the
    bowls containing lump sugar at the National Hotel in Washington, D.C.
    Southerners, he explained, drink coffee; coffee drinkers use pulverized
    sugar; so the southern diners would be spared and the tea-drinking northern
    diners, including Buchanan, would be wiped out." (p. 5).
  - "Buchanan 'became more than ever the tool of the slave power.'" (p. 5).
  - His theories has little evidence. Some were debunked years later autopsy.
  - Wrote _The Adder's Den_ and was published in 1864. New edition appeared 2
    years later, _History of the Plots and Crimse of the Great Conspiracy to
    Overthrow Liberty in America_
  - Drew his theories on floating through Whig and Republican circles for years.


Letter to Lincoln. "I have often heard it stated by Physicians, that it was an
undoubted fact, that our two last Whig Presidents, Gen's Harrison & Taylor, came
to their sudden and lamentable ends, by subtle poisons, administered in their
food at the White House." (p. 6).

"we had a return of that bad water, and two or three Senators—Republicans, mind
you—are prostrated with sudden illness. What does it mean? Why does it happen
that whenever the current sets against the Master Demon of Slavery (and never at
any other time), we find the air, and the water, and the whisky of Washington
full of poison?" (p. 7).

- "Planter elites" (p. 7).

Slave Power alleged agenda to make "slavery universal and perpetual", Lincoln
(p. 7).

"It was a paranoid time. In America, it is always a paranoid time." (p. 8).

"Pundits tend to write off political paranoia as a feature of the fringe, a
disorder that occasionally flares up until the sober center can put out the
flames. They're wrong. The fear of conspiracies has been a potent force across
the political spectrum, from the colonial era to the present, in the
establishment as well as at the extremes. Conspiracy theories played major roles
in conflicts from the Indian wars of the seventeenth century to the labor
battles of the Gilded Age, from the Civil War to the Cold War, from the American
Revolution to the War on Terror." (p. 8).

- "Paranoid Style in American Politics", Richard Hofstadter (p. 8).
- 9/11 and JFK's assassination polled to be likely be plotted by U.S. leaders
  (p. 8).
- Stanley Cohen "moral panic." "A time were fear and hysteria are magnified
  distorted..." (p. 10).
- An essential feature of a moral panic is a folk devil, a figure the
  sociologist Erich Goode has defined as "an evil agent responsible for the
  threatening condition"29—typically a scapegoat who is not, in fact,
  responsible for the threat. (p. 11).
- that the syndicate amounted to an "invisible government," a "hidden hand," and
  a "secret power,k and that "behind our city and state governments there is an
  unseen power which controls them." (p. 11).
- Coerced prostitution led to the creation of Federal Bureau of Investigation
  ,FBI (p. 11).
- "How shall we maintain our honored form of government, or protect life and
  property from assassination at the hands of these conspirators, if their dark
  and damning deeds are allowed to continue and be perfected?" (p. 12)

This enemy seems to be on many counts a projection of the self: both the ideal
and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him. A fundamental
paradox of the paranoid style is the imitation of the enemy. The enemy, for
example, may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him
in the apparatus of scholarship, even of pedantry. . . .  Secret organizations
set up to combat secret organizations give the same flattery. The Ku Klux Klan
imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an
elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy. The John Birch Society
emulates Communist cells and quasi-secret operation through "front" groups, and
preaches a ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar
to those it finds in the Communist enemy. Spokesmen of the various Christian
anti-Communist "crusades" openly express their admiration for the dedication,
discipline, and strategic ingenuity the Communist cause calls forth. (p. 13).

  * This dread had been building throughout the Kennedy years and exploded after
    the president's assassination, which many people either blamed directly on
    the far Right or attributed to an atmosphere of fear and division fed by
    right-wing rhetoric. (p. 13).
- When scholars and pundits aren't claiming that paranoia is limited to the
  political extremes, they sometimes claim that it's a product of particularly
  harsh times (p. 14).
- "Conspiracy theories," Frum wrote, "always flourish during economic
  downturns." (p. 14).
- For the last few decades, elements of whatever party is out of power have
  worried that the party in power would turn fascist (p. 15)
- United States is riven by conflicts. But there is also the possibility that
  peace breeds nightmares just as surely as strife does. (p. 15).
- "it's the most peaceful societies which are also the most haunted, in their
  imaginative constructions of the cosmos, by constant specters of perennial
  war." (p. 15)


This is a book about America's demons. Many of those demons are imaginary, but
all of them have truths to tell us. A conspiracy story that catches on becomes a
form of folklore. It says something true about the anxieties and experiences of
the people who believe and repeat it, even if it says nothing true about the
objects of the theory itself. (pp. 15-16).

Just as an animist treats natural forces as conscious spirits, many
conspiracists treat social forces as conscious cabals. (p. 16)

Take the idea that the football star O.J. Simpson was framed for the murder of
his wife. Simpson was probably guilty, but sometimes the police do frame
suspects, and few would claim that innocent black men never run into trouble
with racist cops.  (p. 16).

_Myths_ are "...culturally resonant ideas that appear again and again when
Americans communicate with one another: archetypes that can absorb all kinds of
allegations, true or not, and arrange them into a familiar form." (p. 16).

"One is the Enemy Outside, who plots outside the community's gates, and one is
the Enemy Within, comprising villainous neighbors who can't easily be
distinguished from friends. There is the Enemy Above, hiding at the top of the
social pyramid, and there is the Enemy Below, lurking at the bottom. **And then
there is the Benevolent Conspiracy, which isn't an enemy at all: a secret force
working behind the scenes to improve people's lives.**" (p. 16)

"Different people adopt and adapt these myths for their own needs, keeping the
scaffolding of a story line in place while changing the content." (p. 17).

"Conspiracy tales can change even more dramatically when a story leaks from one
social group to another. Different people adopt and adapt these myths for their
own needs, keeping the scaffolding of a story line in place while changing the
content." (p. 17).

**Taking fictions at face value** (p. 20)
