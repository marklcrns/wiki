# Chapter 10: The Ghost of Rambo

"Yes, it's an ultraviolent story about a supersoldier refighting the Vietnam War.
Yes, it implies that we could have won Vietnam the first time around if our
hands hadn't been tied by liberals back home. Yes, Ronald Reagan co-opted it,
joking at the end of a hostage crisis, "After seeing Rambo last night, I know
what to do the next time this happens."" (pp. 266-267).

"There are films that intelligently explore the racial and sexual anxieties that
underlie this tale. The most famous is John Ford's 1956 film The Searchers, in
which the captive woman does not want to leave the Indian community; her
would-be rescuer, a complex antihero played by John Wayne, would rather kill her
than watch her become an Indian." (p. 272).
