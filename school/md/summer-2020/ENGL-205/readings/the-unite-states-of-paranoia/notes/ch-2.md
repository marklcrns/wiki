"The fighting that broke out in 1675 is called "King Philip's War," but Philip

"The Enemy Outside isn't defined by any particular origin; he's defined by the
fact that you think he's out there trying to come in." (p. 35).

"At one point the Tribune reported that a battle with the Indians had already
left sixty people dead or wounded. In fact the clash had never occurred." (p.

fever." (p. 41).
