# Chapter 3: The Devil Next Door

The Enemy Within.

"Hawthorne felt considerable guilt for this family history, and it’s easy to read
his story as a critique of a society that set out to destroy monsters but ended
up becoming monstrous itself. Acts done in the name of fighting the Devil, from
persecuting Quakers to slaughtering Indians, appear in the text as crimes
committed with Satan’s blessing." (p. 50).

"Though he intended to resist the Devil, he ended up living his life as though he
accepted the doctrine the Devil preached: 'Now are ye undeceived. Evil is the
nature of mankind.' And it is Brown who adopts the mind-set of a witch finder,
always suspecting that Satanists are everywhere." (p. 50).

"[Goodman] Brown's vision in the forest was itself the Devil's work and that by
accepting it as valid Brown fell into the Devil's trap." (p. 50).

"Meanwhile, many accusations came wrapped in a long history of gossip, as old
chatter about who might be a sorceress, a wife beater, or a whore made it easier
for certain citizens to fall under suspicion." (p. 52).

"From there the circle widened. More purported witches were accused, and many of
them confessed, sparking still more accusations." (p. 52).

"The typical New England witchcraft accusation involved townspeople blaming their
neighbors for various mundane misfortunes. If you look past the fact that the
charges involved the use of magical powers, you'll find that the conflicts
weren't so different from the disputes that modern people have over
rat-attracting junk piles, dogs that dig up gardens, or tree branches that
extend into an adjoining yard. Even by the legal standards of the time, the use
of malevolent magic was difficult to prove, so the New England courts were
ordinarily reluctant to take on such cases." (p. 53).

"The witch hunt encapsulated the most essential element of the Enemy Within:
Anyone could conceivably be-or become-a part of the conspiracy." (p. 54).

"When the Enemy Within is at work, ordinary life is a masquerade." (p. 54).
