# Chapter 12: Everything is a Clue

"October 7, 2001: less than a month after 9/ 11. Police in Maryland decide that
two trucks on Interstate 270 might be carrying explosives. The alert cops block
traffic for an hour, searching the vehicles for tools of terror. The cargo turns
out to be stage equipment headed to a memorial service for the firefighters
killed in the attack. A forgivable mistake, given the circumstances? Perhaps."
(p. 299).

"It was the same species of fear that had flared during earlier hunts for spies
and saboteurs. But now the consequences of failing to spot the conspirators
seemed much more catastrophic. Anything might be a weapon; anything might be a
clue." (p. 300).

"In January 2007, guerrilla marketers erected illuminated signs in locations
around ten cities, each displaying one of the Mooninite characters from the Aqua
Teen Hunger Force TV cartoon. In nine of those cities, the campaign went off
without incident, but in Boston the cops construed the signs as bombs and
essentially locked down the town. On learning that the installations were not
explosives, officials started calling them a "hoax," as though the advertisers
had expected people to mistake the Mooninites for weapons. "It had a very
sinister appearance," Massachusetts attorney general Martha Coakley said of one
of the signs. "It had a battery behind it, and wires."" (p. 302).

"When people enter an apocalyptic frame of mind, the historian Richard Landes has
observed, "everything quickens, enlightens, coheres. They become semiotically
aroused- everything has meaning, patterns."" (p. 302).

"One frequently forwarded e-mail gave readers instructions on how to fold a $ 20
bill, revealing an image that seemed to predict the planes hitting the towers:"
(p. 302).
