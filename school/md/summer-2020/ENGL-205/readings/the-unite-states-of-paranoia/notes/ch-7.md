# Chapter 7: The Water's Gate

Paranoid antidraft activist in San Diego convinced that the Bureau was watching
him (p. 157).

**COINTELPRO**, a program to disrupt and neutralize political movements that the
Bureau deemed subversive. (p. 158)

"They tried to get targets fired from their jobs, and they tried to break up the
targets' marriages. They published deliberately inflammatory literature in the
names of the organizations they wanted to discredit, and they drove wedges
between groups that might otherwise be allied." (p. 159)

"few select top-echelon leaders of the New Left be subjected to harassment by a
series of anonymous messages with a mystical connotation." (p. 159).

This is where the study of conspiracy theories becomes a **hall of mirrors**.
The feds didn't just infiltrate and disrupt dissident groups; they made sure the
groups knew that they were being infiltrated and disrupted, so activists would
suspect one another of being police agents. In effect, COINTELPRO functioned as
a conspiracy to defeat subversive conspiracies by convincing the alleged
subversives that they were being conspired against. (p. 161)

"For that matter, it was easier to think that the government might have murdered
Martin Luther King or Malcolm X if you knew that the Chicago cops and FBI had
assaulted and killed Fred Hampton and Mark Clark of the Black Panther Party.10
Documented misbehavior inevitably fueled speculations about undocumented
misbehavior." (p. 162)

"The anxiety that COINTELPRO had gone out of its way to encourage was now
occurring on its own." (p. 169)
