# Part 8: Prep

## Gibson Wells

  - As he continues his blog, Wells told a story about Lazarus and the rich man
    from the bible and posed a question as to why the rich people always gets a
    bad rap for being rich. Assuming all rich people will go to hell and the
    poor people are treated as a virtue. He also argues that the way people get
    rich matters and what the poor people did to deserve such a fate.
  - "The market dictates" (262). He told a story about how he wanted to give
    people cheaper product by working with companies to make their product
    cheaper. Wells was always firm with his decision for wanting a cheaper
    price, too cheap for the companies he works with. So whenever they do not
    meet to a resolution, Wells pulls the plug and produce his own product
    priced exactly as he wanted that would render all competitions out of
    business.
  - Was he wrong for doing this? He wants whats best for the people in general,
    in their deteriorating planet. He was not driven by greed and seem to be
    true to his words that he wants to have a better world for everyone.


## Paxton

  - Paxton told Dakota a story from when he was still in prison on how some
    prisoners smuggle contraband through drones.
  - He and Dakota were watching from the roof under extreme heat from the sun
    when they saw a handoff and got the skell (Lucas).
  - They took Lucas in for investigation and Dobbs was "... damn proud of you,
    son." (268).
  - They got some information from Lucas that the tech guys hacked some drones
    algorithm to dock on the same place every time to transport the Oblivion.
  - Dakota gave Paxton the news about how the Oblivion dealers get around
    undetected. Turns out, the bands' sensors to detect the registered user on
    the wrist is broken. It doesn't matter who wears them, as long as theres a
    warm body that does.


## Zinnia

  - Despondent about finishing her mission. Because finishing it means killing
    innocent people and Paxton in the process. She thought of ditching her
    mission and just staying in the cloud or running away.
  - Zinnia found out that the bands are broken from Paxton and her hope was
    revitalized.
