# Part 9: Remembrance

## Gibson

  - Gibson talks about the Black Friday Massacre, how it originated. Every year
    theres a Remembrance day ceremony to remember all those who have died during
    the Black Friday Massacre because back then guns were so accessible and
    cheap.


## Zinnia

  - Zinnia placed a ten-pound rubber plates from the gym to the tracks of the
    tram with the intent to derail the tram Gibson Wells would ride into.
  - After setting up her trap. She went to Hadley's apartment and gave her the
    Oblivion she got from the ambulance driver when she went to the hospital, as
    partly to console her, but her motive was to take Hadley's brown shirt (tech
    staff) and CloudBand to gain access to facilities.
  - While Zinnia was working her way into the energy processing facility, she
    stumbled on to an uncharted facility, or so she just didn't recognized from
    the map, with staffs on pink polo shirts. She found out that the facility
    was a waste processing that extracts proteins from bacteria from human waste
    and process into a low-fat protein meat. CloudBurgers.
  - Zinnia got through the energy processing facility and knocked the female
    security guard down. She went inside and saw an underwhelming machinery that
    seemed to be the power source of the Cloud that could barely "fit into the
    back of a pickup truck." (311). She took pictures and ran for an exit.
  - Trying to find an exit, Zinnia came across with black polo shirt men and
    fought with them as best as she could but one of them took a drop on her.



## Paxton

  - Gibson Wells and shook Paxton's hand asked for his name and how he like
    working there. He froze and said that its all just fine.
