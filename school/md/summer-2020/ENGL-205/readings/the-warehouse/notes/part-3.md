# Part 3: Grace Period

## Gibson Wells

  - Thinks about his legacy.  Believes that building an infrastructure should
  - look ahead into the future
    for expansion. Rather than building something on top of an unsteady ground,
    tear the building apart and start from the ground up, with future expansions
    and growing demands in mind.
  - Lobbied the Red Tape Elimination Act, which allows businesses to skip the
    unnecessary government bureaucracies which slows businesses down and cost
    them money.
  - Also lobbied the Freedom from Harassment in Construction Act, which stops
    the Union from keeping people by boycotting to apply at companies who didn't
    hire them. And the Paperless Currency Act. And the Freedom from Machinery
    Act "which mandated hiring quotas, as well as the maximum number of jobs any
    given business can field out to robots." (143).
  - Was very proud of his daughter Claire which he said his other legacy. He
    held her to the same standard as his other employees when he hired her into
    the Cloud because of her persistence.


## Paxton

  - Concerned about Viral that he might be on his ass and pull him down.
  - Had a drinks with Zinnia then went to the arcade to play some video game
    when he saw Warren with a man wearing brown shirt. Didn't get a chance to
    see the man's face.
  - Dakota was furious that he let a lead off his hands. Worst, their
    conversation might have heard by Vikram.
  - For some reason, Vikram might have tipped Dobbs off, he was sent to Dobbs
    office immediately after he left Admin and was reassigned to scanner duty.
    He was frustrated and wanted to make things right.


## Vikram

  - A proud indian man who was assigned to the Oblivion task force promising to
    sort things out to Dobbed but got nothing, so he was assigned to the
    warehouse exit line, among the shittiest security details next to drone
    field.
  - Might be a candidate of Cut Day, where low-ranked employees get notification
    that they're fired.
    * There is a grace period for new employees. An immunity from Cut Day for
      the first month.


## Warren

  - Blonde haired scrawny man in green polo shirt, who deals Oblivion.


## Zinnia

  - Worked voluntary extra shift for good employee rating. She was starting to
    get the hang of her job and started focusing on getting green line.
  - Started making a whole in her apartment ceiling.
  - Met Cynthia, neighbor on a wheelchair whom she helped with her stuff to her
    room, which surprisingly just as constraining as Zinnia's apartment for a
    handicapped person.
  - Had drinks with Paxton after her shift that night and had a great time.
  - Knew that Paxton was following someone from the arcade.
  - Took a shower in gender-neutral bathroom with five-minute allotment of
    water. Pay for extra minutes of shower water. She was pissed.
  - Met a man wearing white polo shirt (manager) in the gender-neutral bathroom
    that sexually harassed her. She did not resisted as to prevent blowing her
    cover.
