# Part 7: Day Trip

## Zinnia

  - Asked Paxton to pull some strings to bypass the long waitlist for the rental
    car to meet her employer.
  - Got an encrypted message from her employer to meet in the bookstore.
  - After the short encounter with Ember and her three followers, his employer
    finally showed up in the bookstore after things went down and gave her
    another task, that if successful will double her current compensaition, to
    kill Gibson Wells.


## Paxton

  - Asked a favor for Dobbs to bypass the long waitlist for the rental car to
    which Dobbs approved right off the bat.
  - As he was waiting outside the bookstore while Zinnia is inside, he met three
    people, two man and a black woman, pointing a gun at him. They got Zinnia
    too in the bookstore. They call themselves the resistance to the Cloud. It
    turned out, the short girl pointing a gun at Zinnia was Ember, the girl with
    lavander pantsuit from the processing who got taken away in the theatre.
    They are also responsible for the brief match incident in the CloudBand.
