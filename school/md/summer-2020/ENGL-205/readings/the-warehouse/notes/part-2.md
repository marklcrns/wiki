# Part 2: Orientation

## Gibson Wells

  - Dreamed of creating drones for air delivery service since he was a kid. pg.
    72
  - His idea of employee rating system initially took a flak and was told that
    his system is "undervaluing" his workers and "oversimplifying a complex
    system".
    * Wells thinks this is a great idea. With around 30 million workers, this
      system makes it easier to gauge his workers performance in a transparent
      and streamlined way. Do an excellent job and you will be rewarded, do
      poorly and you might not be the right fit and be dismissed.
  - "A herd is only as fast and strong as the slowest member" (109).
    * His father teacher him to aim high and to always surpass himself.
  - Used to go to a charter school, a public funded school owned by a private
    company with no government intervention
    * The school standards and regulations are set by the educators rather than
      politicians who have lesser knowledge of the education system.
  - Hates the Union for their selfish unsympathetic negotiations and contracts.


## Ray Carson

  - Gibson's brother-like tech-savvy business partner who is the VP of the
    Cloud. They have been working together since day one. pg. 75.


## Renee

  - Another of Gibson's business partners who is a former military gal.
  - Positive attitude who make things possible. pg. 76.


## Kirk

  - A computer whiz who built Gibson's start-up company the cheapest a computer
    network from scratch. pg. 77.


## Zinnia

  - Starts her training as a picker and placer. Met Miguel Relaunders.  Becomes
  - increasingly concerned and competitive with the colored line from
    her CloudBand--Employee rating indicator. Below 60 percent would have
    negative impact.
  - As she works her ass off to catch the green line, she is looking for a way
    to getting inside the energy processing facility undetected.
  - Was angry about the scanners on her way to exit after the shift, scanning
    under her clothing as the security officer grins while looking at it.
  - After her shift, she head on to Live-play to stroll around where she
    surveiled the area and swiped a multi-tool from Ralph, the racist old man at
    the store register.


## Miguel Relaunders

  - Strong latino man (bisexual) who trained Zinnia on the job.
  - Married to a german man
  - Contented to his current job position.


## Paxton

  - Were offered an extra assignment from Sheriff Dobs to keep an eye for
    Oblivion drugs going around the company.
  - Had his first encounter at a store in promenade. A black kid accused of
    stealing food by a racist old white man. The kid succumbed, as advised by
    Dakota, and payed for the candy bar he claims he didn't steal for peaceful
    resolution. Was told that "Think of it like a reverse quota. The fewer
    things you have to carry upstairs, the better." (125).


## Dakota

  - Paxton's new partner
  - Short hair, built like a young man.


## Sheriff Dobs

  - The Sheriff that deputized Paxton along with other new security guards.
  - Dealing with contraband named Oblivion, a highly addictive modified heroin
    drug that rewires the brain. Makes user's body not function without it.
  - Liked and respected by Paxton.


After Paxton's and Zinnia's shift both of them found their way to cross each
other's path once again at the CloudBurger. Zinnia found an opportunity to
acquaint herself with the new security guard Paxton, the "goof" from the bus, so
he can "social-engineer the shit out of him [to exploit him for her cause]; he
was straight and had a penis." (135).
