## Stack Overflow

Recursion enables an elegant solution to some problems. But, for large problems,
deep recursion can cause memory problems. Part of a program's memory is reserved
to support function calls. Each method call places a new **stack frame** on the
stack, for local parameters, local variables, and more method items. Upon
return, the frame is deleted.

Deep recursion could fill the stack region and cause a stack overflow, meaning a
stack frame extends beyond the memory region allocated for stack, **Stack
overflow** usually causes the program to crash and report an error like: stack
overflow error or stack overflow exception.
