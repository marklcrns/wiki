## What is a Computer?

  - A computer consists of a CPU, memory, hard disk, floppy disk, monitor,
    printer, and communication devices.


<a name="cpu-term">**CPU**</a>

  - The central processing until (CPU) is the brain of a computer.  It retrieves
    instructions from memory and executes them. The unit of measurement of clock
    speed is the hertz (Hz), with 1 hertz equaling 1 pulse per second


<a name="memory-term">**Memory**</a>

  - Memory is to store data and program instructions for CPU to execute. A
    memory unit is an ordered sequence of bytes, each holds eight bits. A
    program and its data must be brought to memory before they can be executed.
    A memory byte is never empty, but its initial content may be meaningless to
    your program. The current content of a memory byte is lost whenever new
    information is placed in it.


<a name="storage-devices-term">**Storage devices**</a>

  - Memory is volatile, because information is lost when the power is off.
    Programs and data are permanently stored on storage devices and are moved to
    memory when the computer actually uses them. There are three main types of
    storage devices: Disk drives (hard disks), CD drives (CD-R and CD-RW), and
    USB flash drives.


<a name="output-devices-monitor-term">**Output devices: Monitor**</a>

  - The monitor displays information (text and graphics). The resolution and dot
    pitch determine the quality of the display.


u<a name="resolution-term">**Resolution**</a>

  - The _screen resolution_ specifies the number of pixels in horizontal and
    vertical dimensions of the display device. Pixels (short for “picture
    elements”) are tiny dots that form an image on the screen.


<a name="dot-pitch-term">**Dot pitch**</a>

  - The _dot pitch_ is the amount of space between pixels, measured in
    millimeters. The smaller the dot pitch, the sharper the display.


<a name="communication-devices-term">**Communication devices**</a>

  - A regular modem uses a phone line and can transfer data in a speed up to
    56,000 bps (bits per second). A DSL (digital subscriber line) also uses a
    phone line and can transfer data in a speed 20 times faster than a regular
    modem. A cable modem uses the TV cable line maintained by the cable company.
    A cable modem is as fast as a DSL. Network interface card (NIC) is a device
    to connect a computer to a local area network (LAN). The LAN is commonly
    used in business, universities, and government organizations. A high-speed
    NIC, called 1000BaseT, can transfer data at 1000 mbps (million bits per
    second).


<a name="programs-term">**Programs**</a>

  - Computer programs, known as software, are instructions to the computer.


<a name="operating-systems-term">**Operating systems**</a>

  - The operating system (OS) is a program that manages and controls a
    computer’s activities. The popular operating systems for general-purpose
    computers are Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Application programs,
    such as a Web browser or a word processor, cannot run unless an operating
    system is installed and running on the computer.


## Programming Languages

<a name="machine-language-term">**Machine language**</a>

  - Machine language is a set of primitive instructions built into every
    computer. The instructions are in the form of binary code, so you have to
    enter binary codes for various instructions. Program with native machine
    language is a tedious process. Moreover the programs are highly difficult to
    read and modify. For example, to add two numbers, you might write an
    instruction in binary like this: `1101101010011010`.


<a name="assembly-language-term">**Assembly language**</a>

  - Assembly languages were developed to make programming easy. Since the
    computer cannot understand assembly language, however, a program called
    assembler is used to convert assembly language programs into machine code.
    For example, to add two numbers, you might write an instruction in assembly
    code like this: `ADDF3 R1, R2, R3`.


<a name="high-level-language-term">**High-level language**</a>

  - The high-level languages are English-like and easy to learn and program. For
    example, the following is a high-level language statement that computes the
    area of a circle with radius 5: `area = 5 * 5 * 3.1415;`


## Interpreting or Compiling Source Code

  - A program written in a high-level language is called a _source program_ or
    _source code_. Because a computer cannot understand a source program, a
    source program must be translated into machine code for execution. The
    translation can be done using another programming tool called an
    _interpreter_ or a _compiler_.


### Interpreting Source Code

  - An interpreter reads one statement from the source code, translates it to
    the machine code or virtual machine code, and then executes it right away.


### Compiling Source Code

  - A compiler translates the entire source code into a machine-code file, and
    the machine-code file is then executed, as shown in the following figure.


## Why Java?

The answer is that Java enables users to develop and deploy applications on the
Internet for servers, desktop computers, and small hand-held devices. The future
of computing is being profoundly influenced by the Internet, and Java promises
to remain a big part of that future. Java is the Internet programming language.

Java is a general purpose programming language.  Java is the Internet
programming language.
