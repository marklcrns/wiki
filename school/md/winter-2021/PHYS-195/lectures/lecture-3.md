## My Notes

### Scalars and Vectors

<a name="scalar-term">**Scalar**</a>

- a quantity that has only magnitude (size, amount, #), **but no direction**.
- Ex: volume, length, distance, mass, time, speed

<a name="vector-term">**vector**</a>

- a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.
- Ex: Force, displacement, velocity, acceleration, magnetic field

| Scalar              | Vector                                   |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| distance = 100 feet | displacement = 100 feet $\angle{}$ east  |
| speed = 3 mph       | velocity = 3 mph $\angle{}$ east         |
| mass = 20 kg        | force = 8 pounds $\angle{}$ $20^{\circ}$ |

> **NOTE:** A vector $\vec{A}$ is represented by an arrow of certain length
(magnitude) & orientation (direction).

#### Vector Addition

Displacement is the Vector sum, AKA the **Resultant**

$$
\vec{R} \text{ (Resultant) } = \vec{A} + \vec{B}
$$

<a name="displacement-term">**displacement**</a>

- The change in position.
- Vector

<a name="distance-term">**distance**</a>

- Length of the path taken by an object.
- Scalar

**Method 1: Head-to-tail**

Calculating displacement is like calculating for the hypotenuse: $\vec{R}
= \sqrt{\vec{A}^{2} + \vec{B}^{2}}$

> A negative vector $-\vec{A}$ is the same as a positive vector $\vec{A}$ but in
the opposite direction

> **NOTE:** we can add (or subtract) only vectors of the same kind. For example,
we can add two displacements, or two velocities, but adding a displacement and
velocity makes no sense.

**Method 2: Tail-to-tail**

Make a parallelogram and $\vec{A} + \vec{B}$ is the body diagonal or the
resultant $\vec{R}$

**Method 3: Component (Algebraic) Method**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\vec{A} &= A_{x}\hat{x} + A_{y}\hat{y} \\
\vec{B} &= B_{x}\hat{x} + B_{y}\hat{y} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Just simply add $A_{x}\hat{x} + B_{x}\hat{x}$ and $B_{x}\hat{x} + B_{y}\hat{y}$.

$$
\vec{R} = \vec{A} + \vec{B} = (A_{x}\hat{x} + B_{x}\hat{x}) + (A_{y}\hat{y} + B_{y}\hat{y})
$$


#### Vector Subtraction

**Method 1**

$$
\vec{R} = \vec{A} - \vec{B} \\
\text{or} \\
\vec{R} = \vec{A} + (-\vec{B})
$$

#### Components of Vectors

<a name="Component-term">**component**</a>

- A component of a vector is the projection of the vector on an axis. e.g., the
	x and y component along an axis.
- A component of a vector has the same direction (along an axis) as the vector:
	negative vector has an opposite direction.

<a name="resolving-the-vector-term">**Resolving the vector**</a>

- The process of finding the component of a vector.


#### Unit Vectors

<a name="unit-vector-term">**Unit Vector**</a>

- is a vector that has a magnitude of exactly 1 and points in a particular
	direction.
- It lacks both dimension and unit. Its sole purpose is to point, that is to
	specify a direction.
- Unit vectors in the positive direction of the x, y, and z axes are labeled as
	$\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, or $\hat{k}$.

Examples

$$
\vec{a} = a_{x}\hat{i} + a_{y}\hat{j} \\
\vec{b} = b_{x}\hat{i} + b_{y}\hat{j}
$$
