# Chapter 5: Force and Motion I

## 5.1 Newton's First and Second Laws of Motion

<a name="newtons-first-law-term">**Newton's First Law**</a>

- If no force acts on a body, the body's velocity cannot change; that is, the
	body cannot accelerate.
- If no _net_ force acts on a body ($\vec{F}_{net} = 0$), the body's velocity
	cannot change; that is, the body cannot accelerate.

<a name="inertial-reference-frame-term">**Inertial Reference Frame**</a>

- simply **inertial frames**, is one in which Newton's laws hold.

<a name="newtons-second-law-term">**Newton's Second Law**</a>

- The net force on a body is equal to the product of the body's mass and its
  acceleration.

$$
\sum \vec{F}_{ext} = m\vec{a}
$$

> The acceleration component along a given axis is caused _only_ by the sum of
the force components along the _same_ axis, and not by force components along
any other axis.

| System        | Force      | Mass          | Acceleration |
|---------------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| SI            | newton (N) | kilogram (kg) | m/s$^{2}$    |
| CGS$^{a}$     | dyne       | gram (g)      | cm/s$^{2}$   |
| British$^{b}$ | pound (lb) | slug          | ft/s$^{2}$   |


Weight is the downward force with which the Earth's gravity exerts on it.

$$
W = mg = \text{ mass } \cdot \text{ gravity }
$$

$$
g = 9.8\frac{N}{kg}
$$


## 5.3 Applying Newton's Laws

<a name="newtons-third-law-term">**Newton's Third Law**</a>

- When two bodies interact, the forces on the bodies from each other are always
  equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
