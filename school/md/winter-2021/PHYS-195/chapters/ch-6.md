# Chapter 6: Force and Motion II

## 6.1 Friction

### Static Friction

- The force $\vec{f_{s}}$ that balances the net force acting on a body that
  prevents it from moving.

$$
f_{s,\text{max}} = \mu_{s}F_{N}
$$

where $\mu_{s}$ is the **coefficient of static friction** and $F_{N}$ is the
magnitude of the normal force on the body from the surface.

### Kinetic Friction

- The frictional force $\vec{f_{k}}$ that opposes a motion in the opposite
  direction once it starts moving from rest.

$$
f_{k} = \mu_{k}F_{N}
$$

## 6.3 Uniform Circular Motion

### Centripetal Acceleration

$$
a = \frac{v^{2}}{R}
$$

where $R$ is the radius of the circle

### Magnitude of Centripetal Force

$$
F = \frac{mv^{2}}{R}
$$
