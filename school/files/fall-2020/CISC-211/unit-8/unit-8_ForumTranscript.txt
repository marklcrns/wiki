What is a single-cycle microarchitecture?

A "single-cycle microarchitecture" is one of the three microarchitectures for the ARM architecture that executes an entire instruction in one cycle. Hence, it is called "single-cycle". Because it completes the operation in one cycle it does not require any nonarchitectural state, as opposed to the other two microarchitectures which are the "multicycle" and "pipelined" microarchitectures that requires nonarchitectural pipline registers. Its advantage is that it is the simplest of the the three ARM microarchitecture and has a single control unit.

However, executing an entire instruction in one cycle could be problematic because the cycle time is limited by the slowest instruction. Its just like driving a Ferrari in a heavy traffic. Also, this architecture could be costly: you cannot reuse parts of the expensive hardware blocks such as adders and memories just like a multicycle microarchitecture becuase everything works as a single unit. Moreover, the processor requires separate instruction and data memories, which is generally unrealistic for single-cycle microarchitecture.
