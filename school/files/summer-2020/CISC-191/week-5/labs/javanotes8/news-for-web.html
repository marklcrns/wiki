<h2>News for the Eighth Edition of This Book</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>May 19, 2020</b> &mdash; Version 8.1.1 is released.  This is a really tiny update,
released for the web and PDF versions of the book only.  The main motivation was a change
in the links to the print versions at lulu.com.  I also updated Section 2.6 to reflect the
fact that the current version of Java is Java&nbsp;14, and Subsection 3.6.5 to say that
the new <tt>switch</tt> statement syntax is now an official part of the language.</li>
<li><b>July 2, 2019</b> &mdash; Version 8.1 is released.  This is a minor update whose
main purpose is to make it clearer how to use the book with Java&nbsp;11 and JavaFX.
The major changes are in Section&nbsp;2.6.  
A few short topics from Java&nbsp;11 and Java&nbsp;12 have also been added.
The main web address for the book,
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes">http://math.hws.edu/javanotes</a>, now
points to the eighth edition.</li>
<li><b>May 15, 2019</b> &mdash; The lab assignments from my Spring 2019 Intermediate Programming
course, using Chapters 8 through 13 of the eighth edition, can be found at
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs225/">http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs225/</a>.</li>
<li><b>December 5, 2018</b> &mdash; The official release of the Eighth Edition.  Once again, I am
indebted to John Ganci, who contributed many corrections to the "beta" version of this edition.</li>
<li><b>August 19, 2018</b> &mdash; A "final beta" version of the Eighth Edition is available for
browsing on the web and for download.
The official release of the Eighth Edition will take place some time after Java 11 is released.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Section 7.2</b>: In the next-to-last code segment in Subsection 7.2.1,

</ul>

<hr>




<h2>Errata for Version 8.0</h2>

<p>This is a list of substantive errors that were found in the original Version&nbsp;8.0 from December 2018.

should be "<span class="fix">The strokeLine command</span>".
<li><b>Section 10.6</b>, next-to-last paragraph of the introductory material:
"The net result is that we've added up the lengths of all the
<span class="error">streams</span> in the list" should be 
"The net result is that we've added up the lengths of all the
<span class="fix">strings</span> in the list.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some Old News</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>November 25, 2017</b> -- My <a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/index.html">CPSC 124 web site</a>
includes programming assignments as well as tests and quizzes from the Fall 2017 of my Introductory
Programming course [using the seventh edition of this textbook].</li>
<li><b>March 19, 2016</b> -- I have added eBook versions of this textbook to the web site, in
"epub" format and in "mobi" format for Kindle.  They can be downloaded using links at the
bottom of the <a href="index.html">front&nbsp;page</a>.  Note that there can be problems with
the rendering of long lines in code samples, and that the problems will be worse on some
devices.  The eBook versions should be considered somewhat experimental.
In addition to adding the eBooks, a very small number
of errors (about a half dozen) have been fixed in the on-line and PDF versions, without
changing the version number.</li>
<li><b>August 1, 2014</b> -- Version 7 is released.  Version 7 requires Java&nbsp;7 or later.
Note that with this version, the book no longer cover applets, and there are no applets
in the on-line version.  Readers are encouraged to download, compile, and run the examples.
Links for downloading are available on the <a href="index.html">front&nbsp;page</a>.</li>
<li><b>May 17, 2013</b> -- Version 6.0.2 is released, with fixes for many small, mostly typographical
errors.  Again, thanks to readers who sent in error reports, especially Mark Christy and
John Ganci, who found many errors.</li>
<li><b>June 1, 2011</b> -- Version 6.0 is released.  The sixth edition adds a new
chapter on threads and multiprocessing and some coverage of new features of Java 6
and Java&nbsp;7.  Thanks to many readers who wrote with suggestions and error reports,
especially to Jeff Wexler who sent a large numbers of corrections.</li>
