<h3 id="weighted-scoring-decision-making-technique">8.2 Weighted Scoring Decision Making Technique</h3>
<p>In the reading for this module we saw an example of product-attribute scoring. This weighted scoring technique is a tool commonly used in other areas of business (not just personal finance) to help us make decisions when comparing multiple options. It’s used for all kinds of decisions; not just decisions about what to buy. I think it’s quite useful for helping us to think clearly about the criteria for a decision and how the different options meet those criteria. The link below is an Excel spreadsheet that you can use to help apply this technique (the spreadsheet is something I teach and use in my BUSE 201 Business Organization and Management class). Please feel free to download and keep the spreadsheet if you’d like.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you’re interested in learning more about this technique, the video below explains how do do weighted scoring in more detail. Again, this technique can be used for any decision - not just decisions about products to buy - so the video is more of a general overview. Once you’re done watching the video (if you choose to) please move on to the next page in this module.</p>

<h3 id="buying-or-leasing-a-car">8.3 Buying or Leasing a Car</h3>
<p>For many people, a car is the second most expensive purchase they will ever make (after a home). It’s very easy to get caught up in the excitement of buying a car and not pay attention to the financial details. Car buying can be more complicated because of all the options in how we buy a car: New vs. used, buy vs. lease, and financing options for example.</p>
<h4 id="consumer-reports-car-buying-guides">Consumer Reports Car Buying Guides</h4>
<p>I think Consumer Reports is a great place to find unbiased information about purchases (like cars) because they’re an independent, nonprofit organization that doesn’t accept any funding from advertising or commercial sources. So their incentives are to provide the best information for the buyers of products and services (the consumers), not the sellers of products and services. This is unlike most other sources of information about products and services that you can find on the Internet. If you’re thinking of buying a car, you may find it valuable to visit the Consumer Reports car buying guide. It is available via the link below. When you’re done looking at the website (if you choose to), please return and continue with this page.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="leasing-vs.-buying-a-car">Leasing vs. Buying a Car</h4>
<p>In the reading assignment for this module we learned about the difference between a lease and a purchase. Leases are a common alternative to buying a car. A lease is a long-term rental agreement with an option to buy at the end of the rental period. Depending on how long you plan to own the car, it might make sense to lease or to own. For example, if you plan to own the car for a long period of time (until it costs more to repair it than to replace it) then it’s probably best to buy the car outright. On the other hand, if you intend to keep the car for just a few years and then to replace it with another new car, then it may be best to lease.</p>
<p>You can also calculate the best financial choice between leasing and buying a car. If you’re interested in learning more about this topic, click on the link below to visit the “Lease or Purchase” calculator at the <a href="https://www.smartaboutmoney.org/">🌎 Smart About Money</a> website, sponsored by the <a href="https://www.nefe.org/">🌎 National Endowment for Financial Education</a>.

<h3 id="buying-or-renting-a-home">8.4 Buying or Renting a Home</h3>
<p>In the reading assignment for this module we learned about housing costs and decisions, including information about renting and buying a home. There are a lot of tools available on the Internet to help you learn more about housing costs and options. One of them - a mortgage shopping checklist from the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/">🌎 Federal Reserve Board</a> - is attached below. Please feel free to download and use it when shopping for a home mortgage. I think it’s particularly helpful in comparing different home mortgage options because it includes a list of questions to ask about the loan options, in addition to the basic loan information.</p>

<h4 id="fixed-vs.-adjustable-rate-mortgages">8.4.1 Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Mortgages</h4>
<p>In the reading for this chapter we learned about a variety of home mortgage options. The two basic categories are fixed rate mortgages, in which the interest rate stays the same during the life of the loan and adjustable rate mortgages, in which the interest rate can vary during the life of the loan. (There are different subcategories of adjustable rate mortgages as well.)</p>
<p>Below is a short video from the Bank of America describing the basic difference between fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages. Please view the video and then return and continue on with the next page in this module.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="mortgage-calculator">8.4.2 Mortgage Calculator</h4>
<p>Before shopping for a home, it’s necessary to identify the amount of money you can spend on your mortgage each month. It’s important to establish this payment amount so that you don’t waste time shopping for an expensive home that you can’t afford, or conversely for an inexpensive home that doesn’t meet your needs and desires. The monthly payment is dependent on the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The price of the home</li>
<li>The down payment</li>
<li>The loan term</li>
<li>The interest rate of the loan</li>
<li>Other monthly costs such as homeowners insurance, taxes, Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI), Homeowners Association fees (HOA), home maintenance, and utilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these factors will allow you to calculate the total monthly payment that you would make on a home mortgage. This can then be incorporated into your monthly budget.</p>
<p>As we learned in the reading and a previous page in this module, the rate and term of the loan can be either fixed or variable. If you select a variable rate loan, the monthly payment may change over the life of the loan.</p>
<p>Please open the Mortgage Calculator webpage at the link below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.calculator.net/mortgage-calculator.html">🌎 Mortgage Calculator from calculator.net</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have the calculator open, please follow the steps below to learn more about how to use it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enter the following example information:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Home price: $300,000</li>
<li>Down payment: 20% (this means you will pay $60,000 “up front.” A down payment of at least 20% is usually required to be exempt from PMI.)</li>
<li>Loan term: 30 years</li>
<li>Interest rate: 5%</li>
<li>Property taxes: 1.2%</li>
<li>Homeowners’ Insurance: $2,000 per year</li>
<li>PMI: 0% (because you are putting 20% down)</li>
<li>HOA: 0% (because you are not buying a property that is part of a homeowner’s association)</li>
<li>Other costs: $3,000 per year for home maintenance and utilities</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing the calculation, notice how much of the total payment over the life of the loan is made up of interest (it should be 31%) versus principal (33%). That means you are paying almost as much in interest as you are for the actual price of the home. Also notice on the “mortgage amortization graph” that the interest you pay gradually tapers off over time. This is because as you pay down the loan, you owe less to the lender and so the amount of interest as a proportion of your monthly payment declines.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Now change the term of the loan from 30 years to 15 years and recalculate. Notice what happens to the amount of interest (it should have declined to 22%). Notice also that the monthly payment has increased (because you’re paying more per month to pay off the loan in half the amount of time). Lenders often offer a better interest rate for 15 year fixed rate mortgages. So change the interest rate from 5% to 4.5% and see what happens to the payment and the amount of interest (both should decline).</p></li>
<li><p>Change the term of the loan back to 30 years and the interest rate back to 5%. The monthly payment should be $1,288.37.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the interest rate to 7.5% (this is the interest rate I got on my first home mortgage) and recalculate. Notice what happens to the monthly payment and the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the interest rate to 3.5% (this is around the lowest interest rate that was available from 2009 to 2019) and recalculate. Notice what happens to the monthly payment and the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan. You can see that the interest rate has an enormous effect on the characteristics of the loan. For this reason, many borrowers are willing to pay “points” - additional money up front - in order to buy a lower interest rate over the life of the loan. “Points” are essentially prepaid interest. It might make sense to pay points if you are going to keep the mortgage on your home for a long time and want the lowest possible interest rate. On the other hand, it may not make sense to pay points if you might move or refinance your mortgage in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the term of the loan back to 30 years and the interest rate back to 5%. The monthly payment should be $1,288.37.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the price of the home to $592,700 and recalculate. (This was the median price of a home in San Diego County at the end of 2018.) Notice what happens to the monthly payment.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment with changing the home price on this calculator until you get to a monthly payment that you can afford in your budget. (Remember to be conservative in your budget estimates.) You can also experiment with different interest rates. Current and historical home mortgage interest rates can be found at <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/current-interest-rates.aspx">🌎 www.bankrate.com</a> or other sources on the Internet.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the price of the loan back to $300,000, the term of the loan back to 30 years, and the interest rate back to 5%. The monthly payment should be $1,288.37. Change the down payment to 0% and change PMI from $0 to $3,000 per year and recalculate. Notice what happens to the monthly payment. This is what happens if you don’t provide a down payment for a home. That’s why many experts recommend that you save enough for a down payment before you buy a home. Lenders usually require at least a 20% down payment to avoid paying for PMI.</p></li>
