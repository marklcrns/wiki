<h4 id="tax-brackets">Tax Brackets</h4>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned about the U.S. federal tax brackets and how people are taxed at different rates depending on how much taxable income they earn (that’s what makes income tax a “progressive” tax). I find that there’s a lot of confusion about what a tax bracket is and how one’s income is actually taxed. You sometimes hear that people don’t want to make extra income during a year because it will “push them into a higher tax bracket.” Phrasing it that way makes it sound like if you earn a certain amount, then all of your income is taxed at a higher rate. But that’s not correct: What happens is that any income you earn over the maximum amount in the lower tax bracket is taxed at the higher rate.</p>
<p>The video below provides a more complete explanation of how this works. Please view the video and then continue on with this page.</p>

<h4 id="three-options-for-doing-your-taxes">Three Options for Doing Your Taxes</h4>
<p>Most people have to file federal and state tax returns each year. But not everyone - depending on your individual financial situation, you may not need to file taxes. The link below will bring you to an electronic tool that will help you determine whether or not you need to file taxes. Please try out the tool if you would like (it’s optional).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.efile.com/tax/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return/">🎬 Do You Need to File a Tax Return?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do need to file a tax return, there are basically three ways to do it. You can:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>prepare the taxes yourself by hand</li>
<li>use software to prepare your taxes</li>
<li>hire someone else to prepare your taxes for you.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to each option, but you (the taxpayer) are ultimately responsible for the accuracy and details of the tax return.</p>
<p>If you decide to prepare your taxes yourself, it can be helpful to use the resources available on the <a href="www.irs.gov/individuals">🌎 IRS website</a>. There are a variety of tax preparation software products available for purchase as well. And you can hire a variety of professionals - from tax preparers to Certified Public Accountants to tax lawyers - to do your taxes for you. This may be more appropriate if you have a complicated tax situation, such as owning a small business or rental property.</p>
<p>All the options can be a little overwhelming, but people generally find a method that works for them. The link below will bring you to a page about filing taxes on the Smart About Money website, sponsored by the National Endowment for Financial Education. Please follow the link and read through the webpage. Once you’re done please click on the “Mark as Done” button to indicate that you’ve reviewed the information, and then continue on with this page.</p>

<h3 id="education-tax-credits">6.3 Education Tax Credits</h3>
<p>If you’re reading this, you’re in college (at least for one course) and so you might be interested in learning more about tax credits you can receive for college tuition and other expenses. My colleague Professor David Wilhelm provided this helpful information about two particular tax credits in an article he wrote for the Miramar College Business Club:</p>
<p>The American Opportunity (formerly Hope Credit) and the Lifetime Learning Credit are education credits you can subtract in full from the federal income tax owed; not just deduct from taxable income! Both tax credits are dollar for dollar reductions in taxes owed based upon qualified expenses paid out of pocket for college. A tax credit reduces the amount of income tax you may have to pay. Unlike a deduction, which reduces the amount of income subject to tax, a credit directly reduces the tax itself. Here is two of them for you to consider:</p>
<pre><code>The American Opportunity Credit can help students pay part of the cost of the
first four years of college. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2010
modified the original Hope Credit established for tax years 2009 and 2010,
making it available to a broader range of taxpayers. Eligible taxpayers may
qualify for the maximum annual credit of \$2,500 per student. In addition, 40
percent of the credit is refundable, which means that you may be able to receive
up to \$1,000, even if you owe no taxes. The American Opportunity Credit is
available ONLY if the student has not completed the first 4 years of
postsecondary education before 2016.

The Lifetime Learning Credit is another credit available and is non-refundable
but can help pay for undergraduate, graduate and professional degree courses –
including courses to improve job skills – regardless of the number of years in
the program. Eligible taxpayers may qualify for up to \$2,000 per tax return.

Students cannot claim both the American Opportunity Credit and the Lifetime
Learning Credit for the same student in the same year. You also cannot claim any
of the credits if you claim a tuition and fees deduction for the same student in
the same year. To qualify for an education credit, you must pay post-secondary
tuition and certain related expenses for yourself, your spouse or your
dependent. The credit may be claimed by the parent or the student, but not by
both. Students who are claimed as a dependent cannot claim the credit.</code></pre>

<h3 id="tax-strategies-and-personal-financial-planning">6.4 Tax Strategies and Personal Financial Planning</h3>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned a little about some strategies for reducing taxes by making particular choices with our personal finances. There are two big ones that I think are worth emphasizing:</p>
<p>The first is the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-936">🌎 mortgage interest deduction</a>. This rule allows people with a mortgage to deduct the interest they pay on that mortgage from their taxable income, which makes home ownership more affordable. In essence, this means that the taxpayers are helping to pay for all the home owners’ mortgages. While this may be seen as unfair by someone who doesn’t own a home (but is helping to pay for other peoples’ homes through their taxes), it’s definitely a good deal for people who do own homes. What it means for you is that if you own a home, the mortgage interest you pay is actually lower than the rate that you see on your mortgage statement because you don’t pay taxes on that money. This can make a difference in financial planning in this kind of scenario: Let’s say you have some extra income that you can either invest in the stock market or use to pay down your mortgage. You may be tempted to pay down your mortgage since you may not be able to get as good a return in the stock market as you can by paying off the mortgage early. However, in making this kind of decision it’s important to realize that paying your mortgage down early means you lose more of the mortgage tax deduction. So it may not make sense. I’m not saying it’s best not to pay down your mortgage; I’m just saying that in making that decision you need to recognize the tax benefits of the mortgage interest deduction.</p>
<p>The other tax strategy is investing in tax advantaged savings accounts. These consist of <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans">🌎 retirement plans</a> like Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) accounts as well as some other kinds of savings accounts such as <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-969">🌎 “flex” health care savings accounts</a>. The deposits made to these kinds of accounts can be used to reduce taxable income (although there are limits depending on income levels and other factors). We’ll learn a little more about these kinds of investment accounts in a later module. For now, I just want you to be aware that they exist and should be investigated when you make decisions about how to invest money to meet particular goals such as retirement.</p>
