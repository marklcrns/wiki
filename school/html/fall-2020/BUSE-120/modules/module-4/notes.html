<h3 id="time-value-of-money-tvm">4.2 Time Value of Money (TVM)</h3>
<p><strong>What is the Time Value of Money?</strong></p>
<p>The most important thing for you to learn from this module (and maybe from this entire class) is the concept of the Time Value of Money (TVM). This concept basically says that money is worth more to us the closer it is to us in time. That’s because the closer money is to us in time, the more liquid, or available for our use, it is. For example, if you borrow $20 from me today and offer to give me $25 when you see me next week, I might take you up on that offer because I could use the extra $5 to buy a something for lunch. But if you borrow $20 from me today and offer to give me $25 a year from now, I probably won’t take you up on that offer. Why? Because the $25 isn’t as valuable to me that far in the future. For one thing, I’m not sure how much I will need it then. And for another thing, I’m not totally sure that you’ll remember to pay me. (Both of those are “risks” I take if I agree to wait for a year before I’m paid). But what if you offered to pay me $100 a year from now if I loaned you $20 today? Then I would probably take you up on the offer because the large amount of money that you promise to give me is worth the risk that you might not pay.</p>
<p>This relationship between time, money, and risk is what TVM is all about. As time increases, liquidity goes down and risk goes up, therefore we demand more money for our investment.</p>
<p>Below is a short video that explains this concept in a different way. Please watch the video and then come back and continue reading the rest of this page.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTMfLUhjb3Q">📺 What is the Time Value of Money</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calculating the Time Value of Money</strong></p>
<p>TVM can actually be calculated in real, dollar terms. In other words, we can calculate how much $100 today would be worth a year from now. We can also calculate how much $100 a year from now would be worth today. I think it’s quite interesting that TVM calculations let us go back and forward through time in this way.</p>
<p>In order to make this kind of calculation, we need to know some important pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Present Value (PV) is the value of the money in the present.</li>
<li>Future Value (FV) is the value of the money in the future.</li>
<li>Starting Principal is how much initial money is invested.</li>
<li>Interest or Rate of Return (I/Y) is how much interest we’re earning on the money during each period.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know any four of these four things, then you can calculate the other missing one. Let’s see how this works by watching the video below. When you’re done watching, please continue on to the next page in this module.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfkqCv3Rd_g">📺 Time Value of Money - Macroeconomics</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Future Value of \$100 in } t \text{ years } = \$100(1 + r)^{t}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is equal to number of years in the future and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> as the interest rate in decimals.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Present Value of \$100 in } t \text{ years } = \frac{\$100}{(1 + r)^{t}}
\]</span></p>
<h4 id="the-power-of-compound-interest">4.2.1 The Power of Compound Interest</h4>
<p>The main reason why time is so important in TVM calculations is because of compound interest. Albert Einstein is credited as saying “compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe.” My roommates throughout college were all physics majors so it was fun to tease them with this quote. But what does it mean? Compound interest is a way to make your money grow exponentially faster by letting the interest you earn continue to earn interest over time. It’s a powerful application of the time value of money.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="tvm-calculators">4.2.2 TVM Calculators</h4>
<p><strong>Annuities</strong></p>
<p>Not only does the Time Value of Money (TVM) allow us to calculate values back and forth through time, we can also calculate what happens if we make a series of regular payments over time in addition to our original investment. This is called an annuity. To calculate an annuity, we need the same information as we used to calculate a future value or a present value, plus the amount of the recurring payment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Present Value (PV) is the value of the money in the present.</li>
<li>Future Value (FV) is the value of the money in the future.</li>
<li>Starting Principal is how much initial money is invested.</li>
<li>Interest or Rate of Return (I/Y) is how much interest we’re earning on the money during each period.</li>
<li>Payment or Annuity Payment (PMT) is how much more we’re investing during each period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The period for the interest rate and the period for the payments must be the same; so for example, if you’re earning 6% per year in interest then you would enter the payments made each year. The same example could also be calculated using months by entering the payments made each month and using a 0.5% interest rate since 0.5% per month is the same as 6% per year divided by 12 months.</p>
<p>Just like in other kinds of TVM problems, if you know all but one of these items, you can calculate the remaining item.</p>
<p><strong>Borrowing is the Inverse of Investing</strong></p>
<p>Incidentally, borrowing is the same thing as investing, only it’s happening in reverse. In other words, instead of renting your money to someone else and earning interest, you are the one paying the interest to use someone else’s money. This can also be thought of as reducing the money you have in the future in order to have more money in the present. That is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing is giving up some money today to have more in the future.</li>
<li>Borrowing is giving up some money in the future to have more today.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve heard people say that this is one way we can “time travel” in real life - by using TVM to move money to ourselves back and forth through time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Finance Calculator</strong></p>
<p>The link below will bring you to a calculator that performs these calculations for you. The calculator also provides some nice additional data, such as how much of your money was actually invested (Total Principal) and how much of the Future Value comes from interest. Please experiment by inputting some variables and looking over the answers. For example, you might try to see how long it would take you to save for a new car if you save/invest a certain amount per month. The more familiar you become with this kind of calculation, the easier it will be for you to make financial decisions about things like loans and investments and the easier it will be for you to complete the exercise at the end of this module.</p>

<p><strong>College Savings Accounts</strong></p>
<p>I hope this module has given you a new appreciation of the value of time and interest in generating money from an investment. One way to take advantage of both of these factors is to establish a college savings account. If you’re taking this class then you’re already in college and so perhaps you won’t be saving for yourself. But you might want to save for your children, a spouse, or perhaps for your own college expenses later in life. Some college savings accounts allow your money to grow tax-free, which is essentially like adding extra interest to your investment.</p>
<p>The link below will bring you to some information and resources on college savings provided by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Please read through the descriptions of each of the resources and click on at least one item that interests you to get more information about that topic. Once you’ve done that, click on the “Mark as Done” button on the top right-had corner of the page to indicate you’ve finished exploring the college savings information.</p>

<p>A Word About College Loans</p>
<p>College debt has become big news. Students nowadays are borrowing much more money for college than they have in the past (Links to an external site.). And when they graduate, many students find themselves in a large amount of debt at the same time they’re trying to start new careers. There are several reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/average-rates-growth-published-charges-decade">📄 Overall, college has gotten more expensive</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/higher-education-funding-in-california/">📄 Many states (like California) are devoting fewer resources to funding higher eduction</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/college-of-tomorrow/articles/2014/09/22/how-do-schools-market-themselves-to-attract-students">📄 Colleges are adding more expensive services and amenities on campus in order to compete for students</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cha.asp">📄 Students are increasingly attending private colleges, including private for-profit colleges</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Are-College-Students-Borrowing-Blindly_Dec-2014.pdf">⬇ Many students don’t understand the impact of taking on college loans (some don’t even know they are borrowing money)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Research seems to indicate that for the vast majority of students, it is not cost effective to take on college debt in order to attend a more “prestigious” college. This is because the expected increase in earnings is not worth the added cost of the student loans to pay for the college. In fact, <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/valueofcollegemajors/">📄 research indicates that a student’s major has a much bigger effect on earnings</a> (at least earnings immediately after college graduation) than the choice of college does. (The only exception to this is very prestigious colleges that are known around the world like Stanford or Harvard, in which case the increase in expected earnings might possibly make up for the higher cost of attendance.) In fact, I’ve heard research that indicates public-funded colleges like the University of California (UC) or California State University (CSU) offer the best “return on investment” for students.</p>

<h3 id="are-you-in-a-financial-crisis">4.4 Are You in a Financial Crisis?</h3>
<p>Sometimes when they analyze their financial situation people find that they’re in a “financial crisis” or a situation where they just can’t make ends meet.
