<h3 id="budgeting-basics">5.2 Budgeting Basics</h3>
<p>The Budgeting Process</p>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned about the five-step budgeting process. This is a recurring process of defining your goals and gathering data, forming expectations about your budget, creating the budget, monitoring the outcomes and analyzing the variances, and adjusting the budget, expectations, or goals before starting again. In the earlier modules we gathered data and started to form some expectations about our budget. In this module we will actually create a one-month budget. Then in a later module we will monitor the outcomes of our budget and analyze the variances. After that you can continue on by adjusting your budget and starting over again.</p>
<p>I update my own budget once a year using this process, and I think it works well. However, it’s a little academic and it probably doesn’t feel natural or comfortable for everyone. Another way to think about the process is to follow some sequential steps instead of a cycle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smartaboutmoney.org/">🌎 The Smart About Money (SAM) website</a>, sponsored by the <a href="https://www.nefe.org/">🌎 National Endowment for Financial Education</a> is a good place to learn more about this approach to managing your money. Please follow the link below to look through the SAM “10 Basic Steps” webpage and then click on any steps that interest you to learn more. You may also want to search through the rest of the website for more information.</p>

<h4 id="things-to-avoid-in-budgeting">Things to Avoid in Budgeting</h4>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned that it’s important to “budget conservatively,” which means to err on the side of underestimating our income and err on the side of overestimating our expenses. This is a fine academic definition, but what does it actually mean in practice? The video below describes some mistakes that people often make when first making a budget (and how to make sure you don’t make these mistakes). I think it’s a good introduction to some important budgeting concepts. Please watch the video and then continue reading the rest of this page.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="updating-your-budget">Updating Your Budget</h4>
<p>In the activities section of this module you will create an initial monthly budget. Budgets can be created and updated for different amounts of time - monthly, quarterly (which is every three months), or yearly are the most common. Most experts recommend that we review and update our budget at least annually, and that we track our actual numbers more often than that. I personally update my budget, along with my other personal financial statements, every year and I track the budget numbers every quarter.</p>
<p>In addition to updating the budget and other financial statements, some experts suggest we do a sort of “periodic financial checkup” on ourselves every year or so. This consists of taking care of all of our periodic financial needs and tasks in addition to updating the statements. The link below will bring you to an article and podcast by Laura D. Adams about taking a “personal financial day” every year to update your financial statements and also review important financial documents and services. Please view the link if you’re interested and then move on to the next page in this module.</p>

<h3 id="windfalls-and-budgeting">5.3 Windfalls and Budgeting</h3>
<p>A “windfall” is a one-time sum of money (or some other good fortune) that you receive, or might receive. Sometimes in life this comes to us in the form of an inheritance, a bonus at work, or even a gift. Windfalls are good things, of course, but it’s quite easy to slip into the habit of either depending on receiving them or spending them in a thoughtless way and then regretting it later.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that the windfall is not a recurring source of income. It’s very easy to count on a windfall to balance our budget. We then get used to spending both our regular income and the windfall we’ve received. But when the windfall money is used up it’s much harder to go back to our former spending habits; we’ve become used to having the extra income. It’s not that spending the windfall is bad; it may in fact be the best way to use the money if it adds the most to your life. But we shouldn’t get used to that level of spending because the windfall is a one-time event. And we especially shouldn’t rely on the windfall to fund our living expenses, because we might not receive the windfall in the future. For example, it’s a bad idea to rely on a bonus from work to fund our living expenses because we might not actually receive a bonus - it’s not a dependable source of income.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider when you receive a windfall is the time value of money (TVM). Spending the windfall now may increase your enjoyment in the present but it takes away from your potential enjoyment in the future. Instead, using the windfall to add to your savings/investments is often a better strategy.</p>
<p>The short video below provides some suggestions on smart ways to spend a windfall. Please watch the video and then continue on to the next page in the module.</p>

<h3 id="ways-to-reduce-spending">5.4 Ways to Reduce Spending</h3>
<p>Welcome back. I hope you found the video to be a good, quick illustration of how powerful time is in saving and earning money, especially from something unexpected like a windfall.</p>
<p>As we read in the textbook chapter for this module, the last part of the budgeting process is about adjusting our expectations and goals and then starting the process over again. Adjusting expectations and goals can sometimes mean that our budget is not balanced, and so we need to increase our income or reduce our expenses (it can mean the opposite too, of course). It’s often easier to reduce expenses than to increase income, so that’s an area that is usually fruitful to explore. You’ll have a chance to practice this with your own budget when you complete the Personal Budget Project later in the course.</p>
<p>For now, though, let’s look at a few common ways to reduce spending in order to balance our budget. The following is a partial list of spending reduction ideas from Eric Tyson, MBA, author of “Personal Finance for Dummies.” Notice that he starts with housing and transportation costs, since those are often the largest expense in a personal budget.</p>
<p>Reducing rental costs</p>
<ul>
<li>Move to a lower-cost rental</li>
<li>Share a rental</li>
<li>Negotiate your rental increases</li>
<li>Buy rather than rent</li>
</ul>
<p>Reducing homeowner costs</p>
<ul>
<li>Know what you can afford</li>
<li>Rent out a room</li>
<li>Refinance your mortgage</li>
<li>Appeal your property tax assessment</li>
<li>Reduce utility costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Reducing transportation costs</p>
<ul>
<li>Research before you buy a car</li>
<li>Buy your car with cash (especially a used car)</li>
<li>Replace high-cost cars</li>
<li>Keep cars to a minimum</li>
<li>Buy commuter passes</li>
<li>Use regular unleaded gas</li>
<li>Service your car regularly</li>
</ul>
<p>Reducing phone bills</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore family plan options</li>
<li>Explore prepaid or no-contract plans</li>
</ul>
<p>Other potential savings</p>
<ul>
<li>Use low-cost hairstylists</li>
<li>Take lower-cost vacations</li>
<li>Avoid buying health club memberships (but don’t avoid exercising!)</li>
<li>Stop smoking, gambling, or abusing alcohol or drugs (these are unhealthy as well as expensive)</li>
</ul>
<p>You could probably add more ideas to this list with a few minutes of reflection. The point is that there are usually ways to balance a budget, even ways that do not affect your overall lifestyle. But we typically don’t consider them unless we go through the process of making and analyzing a budget.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-millionaires-do-it">5.5 How do Millionaires Do It?</h3>
<p>I used to think of millionaires as people who either inherited a lot of money or earned a lot of money through some high-paying job. My assumption was that in order to have a lot of money you had to earn a lot of money. But research tells us tells us that this is not necessarily the case. Instead, in order to have a lot of money you really have to save a lot of money. In fact, many people who earn a lot of money are actually deeply in debt because of trying to fund a lavish lifestyle or other financial management problems. In other words, it’s not what you earn but what you save.</p>
<p>According to a PNC Wealth Management 2013 survey of millionaires (adults with at least $1 million in investments) as reported in Money magazine, these are the things that actually accounted for the millionaires success in becoming wealthy:</p>
<ul>
<li>56% said saving early and regularly</li>
<li>38% said controlling spending</li>
<li>38% said smart investment choices</li>
<li>26% said earning a lot of money.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it’s very interesting that more than twice as many millionaires cited saving as more important than earning. If you’re interested in learning more about real millionaires (as opposed to our often incorrect assumptions), you might enjoy reading The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1485268858&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+millionaire+next+door">🌎 Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko</a>. It’s a research-based book about the characteristics and behaviors that helped millionaires achieve their wealth. I found it really eye-opening.</p>
<p>Another guideline I’ve read about is the 50-30-20 rule. This rule says that when making a budget you should plan to spend 50% of your income on living expenses (your “needs”), no more than 30% on discretionary expenses (your “wants”), and at least 20% on savings/investments. You might try keeping that rule in mind when creating your own budget at the end of this module.</p>
