<h3 id="investment-terms-and-types">11.2 Investment Terms and Types</h3>
<h4 id="investment-terms">Investment Terms</h4>
<p>The reading assignment for this chapter contained a lot of terms and definitions about investments. It’s important for you to learn the basic terms used in investing so that you’re able to understand the content presented in the remaining modules and also the information you’ll find elsewhere about investing. In fact, you’ve probably already heard a lot of investment terms used in the news and elsewhere and you may not be sure what all of them mean.</p>
<p>The link below will bring you to a short article from the <a href="https://investorjunkie.com/">🌎 Investorjunkie</a> website that defines common investment terms (including some that were not covered in the reading for this module). Please read the article and then return and continue with this page.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="investment-types">Investment Types</h4>
<p>In the reading for this chapter we learned about some of the basic characteristics of different kinds of investments, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. The link below will bring you to a page on the <a href="http://www.finra.org/">🌎 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)</a> website that provides descriptions about these and other types of investments. Please look over the page and then follow at least one of the links to learn more about an investment category that interests you. When you’re done, please click on the “Mark as Done” button at the top of the page to indicate you’ve read through at least one investment category. Then move on to the next page in this module.</p>

<h3 id="risk-return-and-diversification">11.3 Risk, Return, and Diversification</h3>
<p>One of the most important concepts in this module is the relationship between risk and return. “Risk” is a measure of variability - that is, how much an investment’s value varies over time. This variability can be measured using statistically by calculating the “variance” or the “standard deviation” of the change over time. “Return” is the change in value of the investment over time. Risk and return are related to each other - higher risk results in higher expected or potential return (on average over time), and vice-versa.</p>
<p>The short video below explains this relationship in more detail and provides some examples. Please watch the video and then continue with this page.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAWxKk9tUME">🎬 Introduction to Resk and Return</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if there was some way to lower the risk and still get a high return? It turns out that there is! It’s called “diversification.” Diversification means spreading risks out by investing in a variety of asset classes that have different types of risk. The assets each all go up and down in value of course (that’s what risk is). But they don’t always go up and down in value at the same time, in the same direction, or to the same degree. Therefore, the overall collection or “portfolio” of investments doesn’t vary as much as an individual investment in the portfolio does.</p>
<p>It’s a neat trick.</p>
<p>The short video below explains diversification in a little more detail. Please watch the video and then continue on to the next page in the module.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="derivatives-and-margin-trading">11.4 Derivatives and Margin Trading</h3>
<h4 id="derivatives">Derivatives</h4>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned that a “derivative” is the term for any financial instrument whose value is derived from the value of another security. The textbook used the example of a contract to buy wheat produced in the future at a particular price. When you do that, you’re essentially betting that the price you can sell the wheat for in the future will be higher than the price at which you’ve agreed to buy the future wheat. The value of your investment, then, is derived from the future price of the wheat. If the price of wheat is high in the future, then your contract will be worth more. If the price of wheat is low in the future, then your contract will be worth less.</p>
<p>Derivatives can be a risky form of investing because they’re based on uncertain future conditions of other securities. They can also become much more complicated than the example presented in the textbook.</p>
<p>The short video below explains derivatives in a little more detail. Please watch the video, then continue on to the next topic on this page.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="margin-trading">Margin Trading</h4>
<p>“Margin trading,” “buying on margin,” and “leveraged investing” all mean the same thing: It’s borrowing money to use for an investment such as a stock. Margin trading potentially allows an investor to make a greater return on their investment, because they are earning a return not just on their own money but also on someone else’s money (the loan amount). Similarly, buying on margin poses much greater risk of loss for the investor, because if the investment loses money they still have to pay back the total amount of the loan. Basically it’s a way to magnify the percentage gained or lost in an investment.</p>
<p>The short video below provides an explanation of buying on margin. Please watch the video and then continue on to the next page in this module.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="investment-strategies">11.5 Investment Strategies</h3>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned about “investment strategies,” which are used for deciding what to do with the money we devote to savings and investments. They help us plan our investment on three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capital allocation, which diversifies between riskless investments (like savings) and other investments that include some level of risk;</li>
<li>Asset allocation, which diversifies among asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and other investments (commodities, real estate, and collectables); and</li>
<li>Security selection, which diversifies among specific investment choices in each asset class (for example, among specific mutual funds or individual stocks).</li>
</ul>
<p>You will create your own investment strategy as an exercise in a future module, so please be sure to read that section of the textbook (12.4) carefully.</p>
