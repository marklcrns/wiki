<h3 id="retirement-planning">10.2 Retirement Planning</h3>
<h4 id="your-life-expectancy">Your Life Expectancy</h4>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned that to estimate your required retirement savings, you need to estimate your expenses in retirement, the duration of your retirement, and the return on your savings in retirement. The duration of your retirement is based on your life expectancy; that is, how long you are likely to live. Of course, we don’t really know how long we’re going to live, but it’s really hard to do retirement planning without at least an estimate.</p>
<p>The link below will bring you to a life expectancy calculator developed at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. Please use the calculator to estimate your life expectancy, write it down, and then return and continue with this page. Note: You do not need to provide your email address to get your life expectancy. Just close that window when you come to it and the website will display your results.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.blueprintincome.com/tools/life-expectancy-calculator-how-long-will-i-live/">🌎 How Long Will I Live?</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="your-retirement-savings">Your Retirement Savings</h4>
<p>Now that you know your life expectancy, you can calculate a rough estimate of your retirement needs. The link below will bring you to a retirement calculator provided by Calculator.net. Please input your own personal information into the calculator to get an estimate of the savings you will need to fund your retirement. After calculating that amount, experiment by changing some of the parameters (such as the percentage of income required after retirement) to see what happens with the result. When you’re finished with the calculator, please click on the “Mark as Done” button at the top of the page and then continue on.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.calculator.net/retirement-calculator.html">🌎 Retirement Calculator from Calculator.net</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully you found the information from the retirement calculator to be useful. However, some people have trouble with estimating all the specific information that goes into the calculator. This may be particularly true for students who are not yet living on their own or settled in their career. If you fit this category, here’s a rule of thumb about saving for retirement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save and invest 20% of your gross income for retirement if you want a better standard of living in retirement than you have now.</li>
<li>Save and invest 15% of your gross income for retirement if you want about the same standard of living in retirement as you have now.</li>
<li>Save and invest 10% (or less) of your gross income for retirement if you want a lower standard of living in retirement as you have now.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Standard of living” means the amount of wealth you have available to spend on your needs and wants. So if you want to live as comfortably in retirement as you do now (or better), save and invest at least 15% of your gross income in a retirement account.</p>
<h4 id="what-if-you-cant-save-that-much">What if You Can’t Save That Much?</h4>
<p>Sometimes when we calculate the savings required for our retirement, the result can be a little overwhelming. This is especially true if you haven’t ever considered how much you need to save for retirement or if you’re already past the early parts of your life and haven’t really started saving yet.</p>
<p>If you’re in this category, Eric Tyson, MBA, author of “Personal Finance for Dummies (Links to an external site.)” has some suggestion for how to make up for lost time in retirement savings. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question your spending</strong> - take a look at the items in the discretionary expenses portion of your budget and see what you can cut</li>
<li><strong>Be more realistic about your retirement age</strong> - the longer you work, the more time you have to save</li>
<li><strong>Use your home equity</strong> - in other words, plan to sell your home at retirement or take out a “reverse mortgage” to borrow against the value of the home</li>
<li><strong>Get your investments growing</strong> - by thoughtfully creating a portfolio of investments that earns good returns over time</li>
<li><strong>Turn a hobby into supplemental retirement income</strong></li>
<li><strong>Invest through a tax-sheltered retirement account</strong> - this helps your investment grow quicker because the returns are not taxed</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-power-of-time">The Power of Time</h4>
<p>In an earlier module we learned about the Time Value of Money (TVM) and how powerful compound interest can be over time. Remember, compound interest means that the meaning that the return your investment earns each year is added to your principal, so that the balance of your investment doesn’t just grow; it grows at an increasing rate. The more time the investment has to grow, the more it grows at an increasing rate.</p>
<p>This concept is particularly important when it comes to retirement savings because ideally we save for retirement over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Take a look at the chart below from <a href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/gim/adv/home">🌎 J.P. Morgan Asset Management</a>. In particular, notice the three scenarios and how much of an impact time has on the results in retirement.</p>
<p>Here are some interesting points to notice in the chart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Susan invests $5,000 per year over 10 years only, for a total of $50,000. Bill invests $5,000 per year over 30 years, for a total of $150,000 (three times as much as Susan!). But Susan ends up with more money in retirement than Bill. How can this be? It’s because Susan invested earlier than Bill did. The power of compound interest over time made more of a difference than investing three times as much, but slightly later in life.</li>
<li>Chris invests $5,000 per year just like Susan. However, unlike Susan he keeps investing $5,000 per year for the rest of his working life instead of stopping after just 10 years. As a result, Bill has well over a million dollars when he retires as opposed to Susan’s $602,070.</li>
<li>Chris only invests $50,000 more than Bill, yet in retirement he has $602,000 more than Bill does. Again, this huge difference is the result of two decisions: Chris started saving and investing for retirement earlier than Bill, and he kept doing it up until retirement age.</li>
</ul>
<p>When people start investing for retirement they are often quite concerned about things they can’t control, such as the stock market or real estate prices. But the truth is that we can control the thing that makes the most difference: time. So start saving and investing for retirement as early as you can (that means now if you have an income), even if you’re only investing a small amount of money. That small amount can grow into a large amount, because of the power of time and the magic of compound interest.</p>
<h3 id="employer-retirement-accounts">10.3 Employer Retirement Accounts</h3>
<p>In the reading for this chapter we learned about some kinds of employer-sponsored retirement accounts. These are plans that employers can establish for their employees to participate in. They offer tax advantages for saving until retirement age. Because the returns on the money invested in these accounts grows tax-free, they can generate much higher returns over time than a regular taxable investment. There are more of these plans now than have existed in the past. Each has different rules about how much money can be invested, the age at which the money must be distributed (withdrawn), etc.</p>
<p>One important thing to be aware of in regards to employer-sponsored retirement accounts is that many employers match the employee’s contributions to their employer-sponsored retirement account, up to a maximum level. For example, if you contribute $100 per month to your 401k or other employer-sponsored retirement account, your employer will also contribute an additional $100 per month to your account. But if you don’t contribute anything, then your employer won’t either. In other words, your investment doubles in value immediately because your employer matches whatever you put in. Employers that do this usually have a maximum limit to their match, which is sometimes a dollar amount and sometimes a percentage of your gross salary. Also, some employers don’t match the funds but rather contribute a percentage of what you contribute. So for example if you contribute $100 an employer might contribute 50% of that, or $50. No matter how much the employer contributes, however, it’s free money to you so if you’re in this kind of work situation you should always contribute to your employer-sponsored retirement account, at least up to the maximum amount that your employer will contribute.</p>
<p>The link below will bring you to a chart showing the major differences among the various employer-sponsored retirement accounts. Please feel free to download and keep the chart, but be aware that some of the information may change because the tax code changes each year. After you’re done, please return and continue on to the next page in this module.</p>

<h3 id="individual-retirement-accounts">10.4 Individual Retirement Accounts</h3>
<p>In addition to employer-sponsored retirement accounts, the reading for this module briefly covered individual retirement accounts (IRAs). These are retirement accounts that you set up and contribute to as an individual (not through your employer). Like employer-sponsored retirement accounts, they allow your investment to grow tax-free.</p>
<p>There are two types of IRAs: “Traditional” IRAs and “Roth” IRAs. The biggest difference between the two is: You don’t pay taxes on money you contribute to a Traditional IRA, but you do pay taxes on the distributions (withdrawals in retirement) from a Traditional IRA. In contrast, you do pay taxes on money you contribute to a Roth IRA, but you do not pay taxes on the distributions from a Roth IRA. There are other differences as well, such as the mandatory distribution age.</p>
<p>The link below will bring you to a chart showing the major differences between these two kinds of IRAs. Please feel free to download and keep the chart, but be aware that some of the information may change because the tax code changes each year. After you’re done, please return and continue on to the next page in this module.</p>

<h3 id="wills-vs.-living-trusts">10.6 Wills vs. Living Trusts</h3>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned about the basics of wills and trusts. The most basic decision you have to make about this is whether you need a will or a living trust. The short video below explains the basic difference between the two. (Feel free to skip over the part at the end about the services offered by LegalZoom).

</ul>
<h3 id="finances-and-aging">10.7 Finances and Aging</h3>
<p>The last topic I’d like to touch on in this module is the importance of financial planning as we age. As people get older, their cognitive and decision-making abilities often decline, making it harder for them to make sound financial decisions and to manage their own finances. This is known as “diminished financial capacity.” It’s important to recognize the signs of this in our loved ones that we may need to care for, such as parents or guardians. It’s also important to prepare for this possibility in our own lives.</p>
<p>The links below will bring you to some additional information about managing someone else’s finances if they have experienced diminished financial capacity as well as managing your own finances in a caregiver role. Please look over the links, copy or write down any information that would be helpful for you, and then continue on to the “activities” portion of this module.</p>
