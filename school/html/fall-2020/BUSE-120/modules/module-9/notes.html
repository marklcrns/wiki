<h3 id="what-insurance-do-you-need">9.2 What Insurance Do You Need?</h3>
<p>The most fundamental thing to understand about insurance is that its purpose is to avoid the risk of catastrophic loss. In other words, it‚Äôs intended to keep you from losing everything in the event of a significant unfortunate event; not to cover every small loss you might incur. I think it‚Äôs important to keep this principle in mind when making decisions about insurance because it can 1) help keep you from buying insurance you don‚Äôt need, 2) help you to identify the insurance that you do need, and 3) keep you from making spurious claims on your insurance, which can have negative effects on your future.</p>
<p>What insurance should you buy? Our textbook covers three basic types of insurance: Property insurance, health insurance, and disability/life insurance. These three provide protection against catastrophic loss of property, health, and income. When deciding what insurance to buy, consider these factors:</p>
<p><strong>Property insurance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do you own a car?</li>
<li>Do you own a home?</li>
<li>Do you have tangible assets that could be lost due to fire, theft, or other cause?</li>
<li>Do you have financial assets that could be lost if someone sues you?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Health insurance</strong></p>
<p>Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), all Americans are now required to have health insurance. If you don‚Äôt already have it through your employer or through other means, you should look into buying your own insurance. You can visit the link below to learn more about individual coverage.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">üìÑ Healthcare.gov website</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Life and disability insurance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Are you single without children?</li>
<li>Are you part of a working couple, and each partner‚Äôs income could support both of you?</li>
<li>Are you independently wealthy and don‚Äôt need to work?</li>
<li>Are you retired and living off your capital?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù to any of these questions, then you probably do not need life insurance. Why not? Because no one else is relying on your income, so in the event of your death no one would be disadvantaged. However, if someone is dependent on your income or is likely to become dependent in the future, then you should probably look into buying life insurance.</p>
<p>If you answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù to the first of these questions but ‚Äúno‚Äù to the rest of them, then you probably need disability insurance. This provides income for you or your family if you become unable to work due to an accident or illness. According to the Social Security Administration, <a href="http://www.disabilitycanhappen.org/chances_disability/disability_stats.asp">üìÑ about 25% of people in their 20‚Äôs will become disabled before they retire</a> (a much higher number than those who will die before retirement). Many people are eligible for disability insurance through their employer.</p>

<h3 id="car-insurance">9.3 Car Insurance</h3>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned about the different basic categories of car insurance. Terms used in car insurance can be confusing since they depend on what damage has happened and by whom. The video below explains these terms and some reasons why you might want or not want certain types of auto insurance. Please view the video and then move on to the next page of this module</p>

<h4 id="the-affordable-care-act-aca">The Affordable Care Act (ACA)</h4>
<p>I hope you‚Äôve enjoyed using our Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook. The major advantage of this textbook is that it is totally free for anyone to use. A major disadvantage is that it is not updated regularly (at least the totally free edition is not). One example is that the textbook was written before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, went into effect, so this item is not covered by the textbook.</p>
<p>The ACA includes a number of different components that affect individuals, employers, health care providers, public programs, and other groups. The most important aspect of the law for purposes of this class is that individuals are required to have health insurance. If you don‚Äôt have health insurance, or if you‚Äôre thinking of changing the insurance you have, please consider visiting <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">üìÑ www.healthcare.gov</a> to learn more about your options.</p>
<h4 id="health-insurance-terms-and-quiz">Health Insurance Terms and Quiz</h4>
<p>The terms used in the field of health insurance can be very confusing. Many of us don‚Äôt really pay attention to them until we actually need health care, and then we‚Äôre often not in good enough shape to truly understand them. The links below will bring you to a glossary of health care terms and an online quiz about health insurance from the <a href="https://www.kff.org/">üìÑ Henry J. Kaiser Foundation</a>. Please complete the quiz to learn more about your understanding of health care terms. You can use the glossary link as a reference while working on the quiz. Once you‚Äôre finished please return and continue with this page.</p>

<h4 id="healthy-lifestyle-choices">Healthy Lifestyle Choices</h4>
<p>Regardless of the kind of health insurance we have, experiencing health problems is one of the surest ways to harm you financially and of course in almost every other area of your life. In fact, most of the advice and information in this course won‚Äôt do you much good if you are not feeling well and healthy in your life. For example, regardless of how much retirement savings you have, you‚Äôre unlikely to fully enjoy it if you have significant health problems.</p>
<p>Some kinds of illness and injury are totally unavoidable or due to chance. But many are not. I think the best (and least expensive) kind of health insurance to have is a healthy lifestyle. From a personal finance perspective, living a healthy life is likely to pay off for you financially in the long run more than earning more income will, because a healthy lifestyle can reduce your expenses significantly by helping you to save on health insurance and out-of-pocket medical costs, as well as spending on unhealthy practices like smoking or illegal drug use.</p>
<p>The first link below will bring you to a ‚ÄúHealthy Lifestyle Test‚Äù from Psychology Today. Please take the test and then review your results. After taking the test, click on the second link to visit the U.S. Health and Human Services Prevention and Wellness website. At that website, use the links to find more information about at least one aspect of health that you could improve in your own day-to-day life. After you‚Äôre done, please click on the ‚ÄúMark as Done‚Äù button at the top of the page to indicate you have completed the quiz and visited the HHS website.</p>

<h3 id="life-insurance">9.5 Life Insurance</h3>
<p>As a reminder, life insurance is used when someone is dependent on your income or is likely to become dependent in the future. For example, if you have a child who is dependent on your income you may want to buy life insurance to ensure that, in the event of your death, your child has sufficient money to live on until they become a self-dependent adult.</p>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned about the difference between term and whole life insurance. Essentially, term life insurance is just insurance that lasts for a specific period of time (the term) and then ends. Whole life insurance is life insurance combined with an investment that lasts for one‚Äôs whole life - it‚Äôs sort of two different things wrapped up in one. The other difference is that whole life insurance is usually much more expensive than term life insurance - often up to 800% more. Whole life is also usually marketed much more heavily than term life by insurance salespeople, because they can earn a large commission when they sell this kind of insurance.</p>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to buying each of these kinds of life insurance policies. Most financial advice that I‚Äôve read says that term life insurance is a better value. However, some people may benefit more from whole life insurance. The link below will bring you to a Consumer Reports (Links to an external site.) article describing the difference between these two kinds of life insurance. I think Consumer Reports is a trustworthy source of information on this topic because they are a nonprofit organization that advocates for consumers and does not take money from companies for advertising or other purposes. Please read through the article and then click on the ‚ÄúMark as Done‚Äù button at the top of the page to indicate that you‚Äôve finished it.</p>
