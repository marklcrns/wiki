<h3 id="checking-vs.-savings-accounts">7.2 Checking vs. Savings Accounts</h3>
<p>In the reading for this week we learned a little about different kinds of accounts such as checking and savings accounts. The short video below provides a little more explanation about the differences between the two.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8pDRX3oaM">📺 What’s the Difference Between Checking &amp; Savings? Kal Penn Explains | Mashable</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="good-debt-vs.-bad-debt">7.3 Good Debt vs. Bad Debt</h3>
<p>One concept that I think is very helpful in thinking about debt is “good debt” vs. “bad debt.” Good debt is debt that is used to buy investments; that is, assets that grow in value over time. Bad debt is debt that is used to buy things that depreciate in value, or those that lose value over time. The reason that good debt is “good” is because it’s used to create more wealth, and that wealth can then be used to pay off the debt. The reason that bad debt is “bad” is because it is used to consume things, and once they are consumed there is no asset left; only debt.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of good and bad debt:</p>
<p>Good debt</p>
<ul>
<li>Student loan (good because a college degree is likely to help you earn much more over your lifetime than the amount you borrowed)</li>
<li>Home mortgage (good because housing usually goes up in value and can be rented)</li>
<li>Business loan (good because the business will theoretically generate income)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bad debt</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit card debt (bad because credit cards are used to finance consumer spending)</li>
<li>Car loan (bad because cars lose value - depreciate - over time)</li>
<li>Personal loan for a family vacation (bad because one the vacation is over there is no remaining value)</li>
</ul>
<p>How much “bad debt” is too much? I believe any amount of bad debt is too much, because it means that you’re spending “beyond your means” by borrowing in order to finance your lifestyle. However, I know that most of us (myself included) sometimes have some bad debt. You can calculate your amount of bad debt by using the following formula from Eric Tyson, MBA, author of “Personal Finance for Dummies”:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Bad debt} / \text{annual income} = \text{Bad debt danger ratio}
\]</span></p>
<p>There are different estimates about how large a “bad debt danger ratio” is OK. However, Tyson states that anything over 25% is well into the danger zone and will probably result in spiraling debt that gets out of control. (In other words, debt that can only be financed by borrowing more to pay the interest.) So if your bad debt exceeds 25% of your annual income, it’s time to come up with a plan to get out of it.</p>
<p>How about good debt? It seems logical that taking on some amount of good debt is a good thing. For example, I believe I will save money in the long run by taking on a home mortgage to pay for my house. However, remember that all investments come with some degree of risk, so borrowing money to pay for investments has at least a certain amount of risk associated with it. For example, if you take out a loan to start your own business, there is a risk that the business will fail and leave you with the business debt and no asset to help pay for it. Also, it’s very important that you can finance the debt by using your income. In other words, you don’t want to take on debt (even good debt) that you can’t easily pay for within your budget.</p>
<p>For these two reasons, it makes sense to limit the amount of good debt you have. The actual amount will depend on your own individual financial situation. For example, a small business owner might have a lot more good debt than someone employed by a corporation. But in any case I suggest you be prudent about the amount of debt you take on, aware of the associated risks, and able to meet the payments in your budget.</p>
<p>Below is a short video about good debt vs. bad debt. Please watch the video and then continue on to the next page in this module.</p>
<h3 id="credit-cards-and-payday-loans">7.4 Credit Cards and Payday Loans</h3>
<h3 id="credit-cards">Credit Cards</h3>
<p>Do you have a credit card? If so, do you pay the balance every month? Credit cards are often considered “bad debt” because they’re used to finance consumer spending and also because they can easily lead to growing levels of debt.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/average-credit-card-debt-in-every-state-ranked-2018-8">📄 an article by Hillary Hoffower published in Business Insider</a>, American households that don’t pay off their credit card balances each month have more than $9,000 of credit card debt on average. Since this is an average, it’s considerably more for some households. In fact, the same article reports that Californians have the fourth-highest credit card balances in the nation. Credit card debt is among the worst kind of debt to have, since the effective interest rates are typically very high and also because if it’s not paid off the debt keeps growing. (Remember the effect of compound interest that we learned about in a prior module? This is the same thing but with debt building upon itself instead of wealth.)</p>
<p>Below is a video explaining how credit cards (and other lines of credit loans) work. Please watch the video and then continue on with this page.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="payday-loans">Payday Loans</h4>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned a little about personal loans, which are “all purpose” loans, or loans that can be used for anything. They are often unsecured - that is, nothing is offered as collateral for the loan - and are sometimes of very high interest rates. For that reason they are often considered “bad debt.”</p>
<p>Payday loans are a particularly dangerous type of personal loan. Unlike most other types of loans, they have very high interest rates and the principal must be repaid all at once. Many people who use these kinds of loans fall behind in their payments and end up much deeper in debt. Because of the significant disadvantages with payday loans, they should be avoided in most situations. However, there are lots of payday loan lenders trying to market them and so it’s easy to get stuck with one if you’re not careful.</p>
<p>Below are two short videos from the Pew Charitable Trusts explaining more about payday loans. Please watch both videos and then continue on to the next page in the module.</p>

<h4 id="dealing-with-debt">7.5 Dealing with Debt</h4>
<p>I hope you learned some helpful information about credit cards and payday loans in the last page.</p>
<p>Speaking of loans, are you in too much debt? According to the Smart About Money (SAM) website, sponsored by the National Endowment for Financial Education, no more than 15 to 20 percent of your income should be used to finance all of your combined debt (other than a home mortgage). Are you over this amount? If so, one of your top financial priorities should be to reduce your level of debt.</p>
<p>Cary Siegel, a retired executive and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Didnt-They-Teach-This-School/dp/1481027565/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1548459926&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=why+didn%27t+they+teach+me+this+in+school">📄 Why Didn’t They Teach Me This in School?</a> suggests following these steps to work your way out of debt:</p>
<p>Immediately stop spending more than you make (probably obvious) Stop using a credit card Keep only one credit card for emergency purposes and throw the rest away Determine how much you owe in total and rank the debts based on their size and interest rates Make a plan to reduce expenses in order to free up cash to start paying off the debt Pay off the highest interest rates and smallest debts while paying at least the minimum monthly payments on all other debts Pay off the larger debts with higher interest rates Pay off the remaining debts with lower interest rates</p>

<h3 id="credit-ratings-and-scores">7.6 Credit Ratings and Scores</h3>
<h4 id="your-credit-score">Your Credit Score</h4>
<p>As we learned in the reading for this module, your credit rating is a measure of your credit risk or risk of defaulting on a loan. In the United States, credit ratings are usually measured by a credit score, which is typically a number between 200 and 850 (a higher number is better). This number is generated from evaluating information contained in a credit report. A credit report is a statement that has information about your credit activity and current credit situation such as loan paying history and the status of your credit accounts. A credit score predicts how likely you are to pay back a loan on time. Companies use a mathematical formula - called a scoring model - to create your credit score from the information in your credit report.</p>
<p>It is important to know that you do not have just “one” credit score and there are many credit scores available to you as well as to lenders. Any credit score depends on the data used to calculate it, and may differ depending on the scoring model, the source of your credit history, the type of loan product, and even the day when it was calculated.</p>
<p>A good credit rating is essential for many aspects of your financial life, including things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting a loan for a home or car.</li>
<li>Getting the most favorable loan interest rate (which can save you hundreds of thousands of dollars during your life).</li>
<li>Renting an apartment.</li>
<li>Getting hired for a job.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, your credit rating affects more than just your ability to borrow money.</p>
<p>Below is a short video explaining the credit score, including some guidance about the effects of different scores. Please watch the video and then continue on with this page.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-improve-your-credit-score">How to Improve Your Credit Score</h4>
<p>As we’ve learned, your credit score, as well as the information on your credit report, are important for determining whether you’ll be able to get a mortgage, credit card, auto loan, or other credit product, and the rate you’ll pay. So it’s very helpful to have a good credit score. Building good credit takes time. Here are some things you can do to improve your credit rating (from the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">📄 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>):</p>
<pre><code>Pay your loans on time, every time. One way to make sure your payments are
on time is to set up automatic payments, or set up electronic reminders. If
you&#39;ve missed payments, get current and stay current.</code></pre>
<p>Don’t get close to your credit limit. Credit scoring models look at how close you are to being “maxed out,” so try to keep your balances low compared to your total credit limit. If you close some credit card accounts and put most or all of your credit card balances onto one card, it may hurt your credit score if this means that you are using a high percentage of your total credit limit. Experts advise keeping your use of credit at no more than 30 percent of your total credit limit. You don’t need to revolve on credit cards to get a good score. Paying off the balance each month helps get you the best scores.</p>
<p>A long credit history will help your score. Credit scores are based on experience over time. The more experience your credit report shows with paying your loans on time, the more information there is to determine whether you are a good credit recipient.</p>
<p>Only apply for credit that you need. Credit scoring formulas look at your recent credit activity as a signal of your need for credit. If you apply for a lot of credit over a short period of time, it may appear to lenders that your economic circumstances have changed negatively.</p>
<p>Fact-check your credit reports. If you spot suspected errors, dispute them. If you have old credit card accounts you are not using, keep an eye on them to make sure that an identity thief is not using them.</p>
<p>The link below will bring you to a short article by Elliot Raphaelson published in the San Diego Union-Tribune that covers some other tips for improving your credit score and for using credit cards in a smart way. Please download and read the article.</p>

<h3 id="identity-theft">7.7 Identity Theft</h3>
<p>Identity theft is an increasing problem in the U.S. According to <a href="https://www.javelinstrategy.com/press-release/identity-fraud-hits-record-high-154-million-us-victims-2016-16-percent-according-new">📄 a report by Javelin Strategy &amp; Research</a>, over 15 million people were victims of identity theft in 2017. I’ve had my own personal information stolen from or lost by three different companies and government agencies. Although none of those has resulted in identity theft, it’s definitely a possibility.</p>
<p>Laura Adams, author of the <a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/money-girl">📄 MoneyGirl podcast and website</a>, lists the following eight warning signs of identity theft (<a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/money-finance/credit/8-warning-signs-of-identity-theft-and-how-to-fight-back">📄 click here if you want to read the full article</a>)):</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrect information on your credit reports.</li>
<li>Charges on your credit cards that you didn’t make.</li>
<li>Charges or withdrawals from a financial institution that you didn’t make.</li>
<li>Calls from collectors about debts that aren’t yours.</li>
<li>Calls from collectors about medical bills that aren’t yours.</li>
<li>Missing bills and statements from your snail mail.</li>
<li>Notice about maxed out government benefits.</li>
<li>Your income tax refund never arrives.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="emergency-funds">7.8 Emergency Funds</h3>
<p>Another financial management tool you may have heard about is the “emergency fund.” An emergency fund or emergency reserve is a sum of money stored in a safe, liquid account such as a bank savings or money market account. The fund is there to be used in the case of financial emergencies, such as an unexpected medical expense or the loss of a job.</p>
<p>How much should you have in the emergency fund? Most sources that I have seen recommend six months’ worth of living expenses. You can determine this amount by multiplying the total monthly living expenses on your cash flow statement by six. That said, you may want to save more or less in your emergency fund depending on your particular financial situation. For example, someone with limited investments and a temporary or seasonally-dependent job might want a larger emergency fund like twelve months’ worth of living expenses. On the other hand, a tenured professor with other types of savings and investments might might feel comfortable with a smaller emergency fund; perhaps only three months’ worth of living expenses.</p>
<p>Another way to think about an emergency fund is as an “uncertainty fund,” because it’s there to deal with uncertain financial events in your life. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/carl-richards">📄 Carl Richards</a>, author of the “sketch guy” series of financial articles, has some advice about how big your “uncertainty fund” should be. It’s a short but interesting article. You can read it at the link below:</p>

</ul>
<p>If you don’t already have an emergency fund, this is something you should look into building. Consider adding a line item to your cash flow statement and budget in order to start saving money to build up this fund.</p>
