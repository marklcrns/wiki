<h3 id="about-mutual-funds">15.2 About Mutual Funds</h3>
<h4 id="mutual-fund-basics">Mutual Fund Basics</h4>
<p>A mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) is not an investment in and of itself, but rather a way to own a variety of other investments. A mutual fund has two main advantages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Diversification, because the fund owns a wide portfolio of securities consisting of stocks, bonds, and/or other types of securities.</li>
<li>Convenience, because you can make one transaction to buy or sell many securities at the same time that together make up the mutual fund’s portfolio.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mutual funds and ETFs have other advantages, including professional management, low minimums for an initial investment, and flexibility in risk level and investment type because of all the funds one can choose from. Different mutual funds and ETFs invest in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks</li>
<li>Bonds</li>
<li>Combinations of stocks and bonds (called “balanced funds”)</li>
<li>Combinations of stocks and bonds that gradually reduce risk as they approach a</li>
<li>target retirement date (called “target date” funds)</li>
<li>Short-term cash equivalents (called “money market funds”)</li>
<li>Stock in particular industry sectors</li>
<li>Stock in companies of particular sizes or types</li>
</ul>
<p>… and many other blends or types of investments.</p>
<p>The returns generated by mutual funds and ETFs comes from three sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dividends and/or interest from the investment securities in the fund’s portfolio</li>
<li>Capital gains resulting from sales of investment securities in the fund’s portfolio</li>
<li>Changes in the prices of investment securities in the fund’s portfolio</li>
</ul>
<p>The link below will bring you to some basic information about mutual funds provided by the <a href="http://www.finra.org/">📄 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)</a>.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</p>
<p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are mutual funds that are traded like common stocks. Shares of ETFs trade like stocks on a stock exchange and can be bought and sold during the day just like stocks.</p>
<p>The short video below from The Wall Street Journal explains the difference between mutual funds and ETFs. Please watch the video and then return and continue on to the next topic on this page.</p>

<h4 id="mutual-fund-and-etf-fees">Mutual Fund and ETF Fees</h4>
<p>Mutual funds and ETFs can charge a variety of fees. These include fees for managing the fund and (in some cases) for buying or selling shares of the fund. The fees for buying or selling shares of the fund are called “load.” They are often quite large - from 1% to 6% or higher of the value of the shares being bought or sold. Mutual funds that charge a load can significantly reduce your return from owning the fund, because the load takes away much of your investment gains. For that reason, many financial advisors recommend that you only invest in no-load mutual funds.</p>
<p>Similarly, the management and other fees that a mutual fund or ETF charges takes away from your investment returns. For example, if your mutual fund makes a 5% annual return on your investment but the fund charges 1% in annual fees, you really only made a 4% annual return. In other words, 20% of your investment returns (the money your investment earned) went to the fund managers rather than to you. Some companies specialize in no-load, low-fee mutual funds, including at least one that is owned directly by the investors themselves (Vanguard).

<h3 id="about-reits">15.3 About REITs</h3>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned about various ways to invest in real estate. One basic method is through direct investment - that is, buying real estate directly and then renting it out or reselling it on your own. The other basic method is through indirect investment - buying shares in an entity or group that owns real estate. One of the most common ways to invest indirectly in real estate is through a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).</p>

<h3 id="investment-advisors-and-robo-advisors">15.4 Investment Advisors and Robo-Advisors</h3>
<h4 id="investment-advisors-and-the-now-dead-fiduciary-rule">Investment Advisors and the (Now Dead) Fiduciary Rule</h4>
<p>As we learned in an earlier module, there are plenty of people available to give you advice about investing. Some of these are essentially salespeople, who make their living off of the commissions they earn from convincing you to invest in particular products. Others are fiduciaries, who are required by law to act in your best interest when giving financial advice. Instead of earning a commission by getting you to invest in particular products, fiduciaries usually charge a flat fee or a percentage of the total assets you have invested. Here’s an explanation of the difference by <a href="https://www.fool.com/">📄 The Motley Fool</a> that was published in the San Diego Union-Tribune on October 29, 2017:</p>
<pre><code>Many people who work as financial advisers aren&#39;t legally required to have their
clients&#39; best interests at heart. Unlike lawyers or doctors, who are bound by
oath to do no harm or to represent their clients&#39; interests faithfully,
financial planners and advisers are free to sell any manner of subpar products.

The &quot;fiduciary rule,&quot; proposed under the Obama administration, seeks to resolve
this conflict by making advisers legally bound to serve their clients&#39; interests
in matters related to retirement accounts. (Some already do so, of course.) It
hasn&#39;t fully taken effect yet, though, and the new administration in Washington
is reviewing the rule, with its future hanging in the balance.

Why would anyone object to the rule? Well, it all comes down to fees. Even a
small difference in the fees between one investment and another can make a huge
difference over a long period. When financial advisers recommend high-fee
products in order to line their own pockets, it hurts your ability to save for
retirement. This can happen if, for example, a financial adviser was being paid
a commission by a mutual fund to steer people toward that particular fund.

The problem is systemic. A study of the 1.2 million financial advisers
registered in the U.S. from 2005 to 2015 found that 7 percent of them had
misconduct on their records. The problem is even more pronounced at big firms,
where as many as 15 percent of advisers have a stained record. To make matters
worse, &quot;Roughly one third of advisers with misconduct are repeat offenders.&quot; The
White House noted last year that &quot;conflicts of interest in retirement advice
cost America&#39;s families an estimated $17 billion a year.&quot;

Even if the worst happens and the fiduciary rule is struck down, you can still
take steps to protect yourself. If you have a financial adviser, make sure they
are a fiduciary and legally required to put your interests first. Advisers
designated as &quot;fee only&quot; won&#39;t be looking to earn commissions from selling you
products, and you can seek one at napfa.org.</code></pre>
<p>In mid-2018, as the article puts it, the “worst happened”: The fiduciary rule was reversed by the courts. So investment advisors are still not required to act in their clients’ best interests - instead they can continue to recommend investments that primarily benefit themselves rather than their customers.</p>
<p>What does this mean for me and you? In an <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/is-the-fiduciary-rule-dead-or-alive-what-its-fate-means-to-you-2018-03-16">📄 article published by Market Watch</a>, reporter <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/author/alessandra-malito">📄 Alessandra Malito</a> recommends that we do the following when choosing an investment advisor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask financial advisers for their credentials.</li>
<li>Look up potential advisers and what their certifications mean as well as their backgrounds with tools like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/">📄 BrokerCheck</a>, which shows any complaints and years of service for brokers and firms.</li>
<li>Ask how much they get paid, how they get paid and what various fees mean.</li>
<li>Know what investment products are being suggested or used, and how they are managed.</li>
<li>Research advice, such as rolling over your assets from a 401(k) to an individual retirement account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another Alternative - Robo-Advisors</p>
<p>We learned in an earlier module that investment advisors include brokers (who are not necessarily required to act in their client’s best interests) and fiduciaries (who are). There is now a third category of investment advisors, who are not people at all. They’re robots. Or at least “Robo-Advisors.” Here’s <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/best-robo-advisors/">📄 a description from Nerd Wallet</a>:</p>
<p>A robo-advisor is an online, automated portfolio management service. Because these companies use computer algorithms – a set of rules to choose appropriate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon – they can offer robo-advisor services for a fraction of the cost of a human financial advisor. That lower-cost management, combined with features like automatic portfolio rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting, can translate into higher net returns for investors….</p>
<p>A robo-advisor is a good fit for you if you prefer to be largely hands-off with your investments – letting someone else do the work of building and optimizing your portfolio – and you don’t have the kind of complex financial situation that requires a direct relationship with a human financial advisor.</p>
<p>There are a number of robo-advisors available, both from large traditional investing firms and also from new, smaller companies. Some organizations even offer a combination of robo-advisors and human advisors. Visit the link below if you’d like to see a list of recommended robo-advisors from Nerd Wallet.</p>

<h3 id="more-about-investing">15.5 More About Investing</h3>
<p>At this point you might be interested in learning more about investing. Our BUSE 120 course just covers the basics about what investing is, the different types of investments you can make, and how to do it. However, Miramar College offers another course that covers investing in more detail. The course is BANK 103 Introduction to Investments. It presents some basic concepts such as investment markets, transactions, planning, information, risk, and return. It also includes information about various investment vehicles, including common stock, fixed-income securities, derivative securities, and mutual funds. Please consider enrolling in the course if you’d like to learn more.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we’ll take a short quiz about investment fundamentals from the <a href="http://www.finra.org/">📄 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)</a>. The quiz covers many of the topics we’ve learned about during the last several modules in this class. I think it’s a good way to check your knowledge of basic investing concepts. Please follow the link and take the quiz. When you’re done, click on the “Mark as Done” button on the top of the page and then return and continue on to the “assignments” section of this module.</p>
