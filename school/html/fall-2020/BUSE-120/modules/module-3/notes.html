<h3 id="savings-vs.-investments">3.2 Savings vs. Investments</h3>
<p>In this module and later in the class you’ll see the terms “savings” and “investments” used quite a bit. For example, in the cash flow statement we’ll create in the module assignment there is a section called “Savings/Investments.” These terms might seem interchangeable: They both involve putting money aside for the future instead of spending it in the present. In both there’s an expectation that your money will make more money (that is a “return” on your savings or investment). And they can feel the same because in both cases it’s money that is put aside for the future. However, there is an important difference that we should understand before moving forward:</p>
<p>In the field of personal finance, “savings” is often defined as stored money (cash) that you own. It might be put into in a savings account, a Certificate of Deposit (CD), a money market account, or even hidden under your mattress (not advised). However your savings is stored, it’s still essentially your cash.</p>
<p>Investing, on the other hand, is using your money to buy an asset that you think will generate a return (that is, make more money) over time. So when you invest you own something <em>other than cash</em>. Examples of investments include stocks (partial ownership in companies), bonds (loans to companies or governments), and real estate (ownership of land and/or the structures on the land).</p>
<p>Savings are typically used for short-term goals (three years or less) and emergencies where you need access to your cash right away. Investments are typically used for medium- or long-term goals (over three years) where you don’t need immediate access to your cash. Another way to say this is that savings are more “liquid” than investments.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning more about the role of saving vs. investing in building wealth, <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/saving-money-vs-investing-money-358062">🌎 here’s a link to an article by Joshua Kennnon</a> explaining the different roles these play in managing our personal finances.</p>
<p>The chart below is a concise description of the differences between saving and investing. Please review the differences to be sure you’re familiar with these concepts and then move on to the next page in this module.</p>

<td><strong>Earn interest</strong><br>You can earn interest by putting money in a savings account, but savings accounts generally earn a lower return than investments.</td>
<td><strong>Potential for profit</strong><br>Investments have the potential for higher return than a regular savings account. Your investments may appreciate (go up in value) over time. This increases your net worth, which is the value of your assets (what you own) minus your liabilities (what you owe). If you sell for higher price than you invested initially, you make a profit.</td>

<h3 id="the-three-financial-statements">3.3 The Three Financial Statements</h3>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned about the three common financial statements used in business and personal finance. They are the income statement, the cash flow statement, and the balance sheet. Sometimes it can get confusing trying to distinguish among them. Here’s a brief description that may help:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>income statement</strong> is a record of your recurring income and expenses over a period of time (usually one year). “Recurring” means they happen again and again (at least once per year). This basically shows the day-to-day operations of running your life; how money regularly comes in and regularly goes out.</li>
<li>The <strong>cash flow statement</strong> is very similar to the income statement, but it includes everything that you’ve spent money on during a period of time (again, usually one year). “Everything” means non-recurring expenses as well as recurring expenses. So, for example, if you bought a car during this time period that would appear on the cash flow statement but not on the income statement.</li>
<li>The <strong>balance sheet</strong> is a snapshot in time of your assets and liabilities; that is, everything you own and everything you owe. The balance sheet is unlike the other two statements because it does not cover a period of time at all; it’s just an instantaneous record, sort of like an inventory.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of this module you will create your own cash flow statement and your own balance sheet. We’re not going to create an income statement because 1) I think it’s more helpful to have a record of everything that you spend money on; not just the recurring items, and 2) The two statements are very similar.</p>
<p>Together, these statements answer the questions “where am I?” and “what happened?” The balance sheet tells you where you are in terms of your finances - what you have and what you owe. And the cash flow statement tells you what happened - where your money came from and where it went. It’s a great idea to update these statements periodically (every year is most common) so you can keep track of your financial situation as you go through life.</p>
<p>As I indicated earlier, the terms you see in the spreadsheet we’ll use for these two statements might be a little different than the terms used in the book, and they also might be a little different than the terms you see from other sources. The important part is to understand the basic concepts and procedures.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-track-of-financial-records">3.4 Keeping Track of Financial Records</h3>
<p>To create your cash flow statement and balance sheet during the “Activities” portion of this module you will need to find and enter information about your financial situation: Things like what your financial accounts, physical property that you own, your income, and how you spend your money. You probably won’t be able to exactly account for every dollar of these items (I can’t), but you will need to be able to estimate them to a reasonably accurate level. Usually this kind of information can be found on a variety of documents. Here are some common ones:</p>
<p>Recent pay stubs Tax returns Bank statements Bill payment records Credit card statements Checkbook register or a log of checks paid Monthly debit card transactions Investment account statements</p>
<p>Many people take a while to find all of these because they don’t have them organized in a way that makes it easy to access them. Also, it’s difficult to know where we should store some of them. For example, should we keep a hard copy or PDF record of our savings account statement each month? Or is it OK to just be able to access it online? What about things like marriage certificates or life insurance documents?</p>
<p>Laura D. Adams, a financial educator and creator of the “Moneygirl” podcast has created a “blueprint” of suggestions about how to store and access various kinds of personal finance records. A copy of the blueprint is available below; please feel free to download and view it if you think it will be helpful. I’ve enjoyed listening to Ms. Adams’ podcasts for several years; she has a great knack of providing a lot of good personal finance information in short, easy to understand podcasts.

<h3 id="net-worth-and-savings-rate">3.5 Net Worth and Savings Rate</h3>
<h4 id="total-net-worth">Total Net Worth</h4>
<p>The usual way we calculate net worth for an individual (or for a company) is to add up everything the person owns - money, stocks, retirement accounts, car, clothes, house, etc. - and then subtract everything the person owes - home mortgage, car loan, personal loan, education loan, etc. The remainder is the person’s “Net Worth.” This calculation is done on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>This is a useful way to see what you’re “worth” overall, but I don’t think it’s very useful in helping us to make decisions about our personal finances. Why not? Because for the most part our tangible assets - our physical possessions - are not really things we can easily convert to cash for other uses. (In other words, tangible assets are not very liquid.) For example, if you own your own home it is certainly an asset, but not one that you can easily convert to cash unless you plan to sell or refinance it. Similarly, our long-term liabilities - that is, loans that come due longer than one year in the future - are also not very liquid. These types of loans do affect our cash flow because we have to pay principal and interest on them, but they don’t have a significant affect on our financial position (at least in the short term) because they’re paid off over a long period of time - typically over many years. Also, long term loans are usually used to finance tangible assets. For example, a home mortgage is used to finance a home.</p>
<h4 id="financial-net-worth">Financial Net Worth</h4>
<p>In addition to Total Net Worth, I like to look at “Financial Net Worth,” which excludes tangible assets and long-term liabilities. Financial Net Worth shows us how much money we would have if we paid off all of our short-term debts (those due within a year or less) but did not sell any of our tangible property. It’s basically a measure of our net worth that is relatively liquid. That is, the portion of our net worth that can be converted to cash relatively quickly and easily.</p>
<p>That said, there is no set rule about this. If you want to include a home that you own among your financial assets then please go ahead and list it that way on your balance sheet if you actually treat it as a financial asset. You might choose to do that, for example, if you own the home for investment purposes and not necessarily as a place of residence. The important thing is to account for all your assets and liabilities in a way that makes sense to you and to do it consistently so that you can see changes over time.</p>
<h4 id="savings-rate">Savings Rate</h4>
<p>Another reason Financial Net Worth is helpful is because it allows us to calculate a savings rate. The savings rate is the change in your savings and investments over a period of time (usually a year). If you calculate your Financial Net Worth every year, you can use the difference between these amounts from year to year to see how much and how quickly you are saving. Financial Net Worth takes all of your financial factors into account - your assets as well as your liabilities - so it’s sort of a “total picture” of where your finances are. You would not want your tangible assets to be included in this kind of analysis because many tangible assets decline in value (or “depreciate”) over time. For example, a car you’ve been driving for ten years is worth less today than when you first bought it ten years ago. You would not want to include the car in your calculation of a savings rate because the decline in the car’s value would make it look like you are saving less than you really are.</p>
<h3 id="software-tools">3.6 Software Tools</h3>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned a little about software that can be used to help us manage our finances. Software and the technology that supports it changes rapidly and so there are new products available today that were not available even a few years ago.</p>
<p>My own opinion is that personal finance software is not really necessary. I don’t use any particular software to manage my personal finances, other than Excel spreadsheets. I’ve tried one or two personal finance software products, but I found that they took more time and effort than I was willing to devote to them. That said, you may want to try out some personal finance software and see how it works for you.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-wasting-time">3.7 Avoid Wasting Time</h3>
<p>The last thing I want to share before we move on to the Assignments section of this module is the idea of using our time effectively in managing our finances. I’ve known some people who track and account for every dollar they spend, sometimes listing them in large spreadsheets or entering them in a software system like Quicken. I think it’s great to do that if you enjoy spending your time that way. I also think it’s a very productive exercise to closely track your expenses for a couple of weeks (we’ll do that in this class). But I don’t think it’s a good use of time to do this on an ongoing basis. Why? Because most of us are busy and there are much more effective ways to use the limited time we have available for managing my personal finances. For example, I think it’s much more helpful to update my cash flow statement and my balance sheet and to create a budget every year than it is to track each individual thing I spend money on. The financial statements give me the “big picture” on where my finances are; not the unnecessary detail about every transaction I make.</p>
<p>There are other helpful ways to save time in managing your finances. For example, many companies allow you to pay your monthly bills by automatic deduction from your checking account. Or you can pay bills electronically from your bank’s website. I think it’s also a good idea to set aside some time on the same day each week to do this kind of work - it cuts down on the amount of time you spend dealing with finances if you do them all at once on a periodic basis.</p>
