<h3 id="managing-your-career">16.2 Managing Your Career</h3>
<p>Unless you’ve inherited a lot of money, the vast majority of your income is likely to come from selling your labor - that is, from working. The choices you make in your career, therefore, are instrumental to your overall financial wellbeing (and also to your wellbeing in other areas of your life). This course is basically about how to manage your money after you’ve earned it. However, it’s at least equally as important to manage the process of earning your money; in other words, to manage your career.</p>
<p>The link below is an article by <a href="https://scottmautz.com/">📄 Scott Mautz</a> published in the San Diego Union-Tribune on April 22, 2018. I think it has some great general advice that applies to virtually any job. Please read through the article and then continue on with this page.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Timeless%20Success%20Tips.html">📄 Timeless Success Tips</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Career planning is way too broad a topic to cover in one module. In fact, you could take an entire course on just that topic. Our reading for this module covered the basic process of choosing, finding, and leaving a job. There are a few points in this process that I’ll emphasize in the next few module pages.</p>
<h3 id="career-exploration">16.3 Career Exploration</h3>
<h4 id="your-career-interests">Your Career Interests</h4>
<p>If you’re not already in a career field (or if you are in one but want to make a change), it’s important to do some exploration to determine what kind of career would be best for you. Ideally, you want a career that combines three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Something you love to do</li>
<li>Something you can do well</li>
<li>Something someone will pay for you to do</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people start their career exploration with the first of these - by determining their career interests. The link below will bring you to an inventory (a type of test with no right or wrong answers) that will help you assess your “work personality type.” This inventory and its personality categories are used widely in the field of career planning. Please take the inventory, read about your results, and research more on the <a href="https://www.cacareerzone.org/">📄 California CareerZone</a> website if you wish.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cacareerzone.org/ip/">📄 Interest Profiler from California CareerZone</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="your-skills">Your Skills</h4>
<p>The second component of finding your ideal career is to determine what you do well. This area of your career is often developed very slowly over time: Typically people progress from job to job in the same career field or a set of related career fields, learning and becoming more skilled with each job. So if you’re just starting out in life, you may not do anything very well yet (sorry). But going to college or getting other kinds of initial training and education is an important first step.</p>
<p>It might also be helpful for you to explore the types of skills used in various kinds of jobs to see which ones you possess (or are interested in learning). The link below will bring you to a “skills profiler” from California CareerZone. Please take the profiler, read about your results, explore the website more if you would like, and then return and continue with the next topic on this page.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cacareerzone.org/skills/">📄 Skills Profiler from California CareerZone</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="career-options">Career Options</h4>
<p>The third component of finding your ideal career is to find something that someone is willing to pay for you to do. Basically this means finding a career field that makes you employable. As we learned in the reading, the labor market is the place where people sell their labor to employers. Because labor is valued at different levels, jobs may be easier or harder to find - and may pay more or less - based on how many people are available in the labor pool. If there are a lot of people willing and able to do the job, the pay will be lower. If there are not many people who can do the job (or who want to), the pay will be higher.</p>
<p>The link below will bring you to the <a href="https://www.careeronestop.org/">📄 CareerOneStop</a> website provided by the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/">📄 U.S. Department of Labor</a>. On the main homepage there are a set of links for different kinds of job seekers (young adults, veterans, people with disabilities, etc.). Please click on the link that most closely matches yourself and then explore the resources to learn more about career fields and options that might be appropriate for your situation and stage in life. Feel free to explore other parts of the “CareerOneStop” as well, of course. After you’re done exploring the website, please return and continue with the next topic on this page.</p>

<h3 id="networking-and-the-personal-pitch">16.4 Networking and the Personal Pitch</h3>
<p>Did you know that most people find their jobs through networking? That means they hear about the job through a person rather than via a job listing or other source. In fact, 70-80% of jobs are never advertised online or in print! So when searching for a job, it’s important to let others know what you can do and what type of position you are looking for. This type of communication is sometimes called a “personal pitch.” It’s used not only in job searches but also in business development, finding clients, networking within an industry, etc.</p>
<p>The link below is a worksheet that you can fill out to help develop your own personal pitch. It’s a great idea to do this if you plan to be looking for a job, because it can really help as a way to introduce yourself to others in a short period of time. It’s also the most appropriate way to answer one of the most common first questions in an interview: “Tell me about yourself.”</p>

<p>The video below is an example of what a personal pitch looks like. Notice how quick it is (around 30 seconds). For this reason it’s often called an “elevator pitch” because it’s something you can deliver in the time it takes to ride in an elevator between floors. When you’re done watching the video please continue to the next page in this module.</p>
<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">16.5 Putting it All Together</h3>
<p>I feel like we covered a lot of ground in this class: Financial statements, budgets, savings, debt, insurance, retirement, investments, and more. I imagine it might feel a little overwhelming if this is your first exposure to personal finance. I sometimes feel the same way myself!</p>
<p>That said, my opinion is that managing your personal finances does not really need to be that difficult or time consuming. Sure, once in a while you’ll need to make some big decisions such as which insurance policy to buy or how to invest your retirement savings. But most of the time you can set up your personal finances on “automatic pilot” and just check in periodically (like once a week or once a month) to see how things are going. I think the more convenient, simple, and organized you make your personal finances the easier it will be to keep them running well and on track.</p>
<p>I heard a podcast about personal finance a while ago that interested me so much that I bought the book it featured. The book is called “The Index Card: Why Personal Finance Doesn’t Have to Be Complicated” by Helaine Olen and Harold Pollack (Links to an external site.). Pollack is a professor who wrote down some personal finance principles he derived from research he conducted for his own personal financial situation. The principles fit on just one index card (thus the name). If you’re feeling a little overwhelmed by the content in this course and just want some basic, practical advice about how to manage your money then the advice on this card and/or the book may be of interest to you. Here are the principles and a copy of the card:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Strive to save 10 to 20 percent of your income.</li>
<li>Pay your credit card balance in full every month.</li>
<li>Max out your 401(k) and other tax-advantaged savings accounts.</li>
<li>Never buy or sell individual stocks.</li>
<li>Buy inexpensive, well-diversified mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.</li>
<li>Make your financial advisor commit to the fiduciary standard.</li>
<li>Buy a home when you are financially ready.</li>
<li>Insurance - Make sure you’re protected.</li>
<li>Do what you can to support the social safety net.</li>
<li>Remember the index card.</li>
</ol>
<p>The short video below from <a href="https://www.npr.org/">📄 National Public Radio (NPR)</a> is about “the index card.”</p>
