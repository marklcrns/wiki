<h3 id="our-biased-thinking">12.2 Our Biased Thinking</h3>
<h4 id="behavioral-biases">Behavioral Biases</h4>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned about the concept of behavioral biases that can affect our financial decision making. Behavioral biases are preferences or beliefs that interfere with our ability to think objectively, particularly about our money and investments. (I think this is a fascinating field of study with a lot of relevance for individual investors.)</p>
<p>Our textbook provided a few examples of behavioral biases, such as availability and representativeness. The link below will bring you to a short article describing some other types of biases that are common problems in investing. There’s also a video right under the link that describes some common cognitive errors that happen in many different areas of life (not just our finances). Please either read the article or view the video (or ideally both), click on the “Mark as Done” button at the top of the page, and then continue reading this page.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEwGBIr_RIw">📺 12 Cognitive Biases Explained - How to Think Better and More Logically Removing Bias</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="recency-bias">Recency Bias</h4>
<p>Jill Schlesinger, author of <a href="https://www.jillonmoney.com/book">📄 The Dumb Things Smart People Do with Their Money</a> believes that recency bias is one of the most common errors we make in investing. Recency bias is the tendency for us to believe that events that happened most recently are the ones that are most likely to happen in the future. For example, many people feel an impulse to buy into the stock market when stock prices are rising, because recency bias makes us think that they will continue to rise. It’s sort of a “short term thinking” phenomenon.</p>
<p>Here’s what Schlesinger has to say about recency bias:</p>
<p>The tendency to remember recent events more vividly and give recent information more weight than historical information, can cause us to believe that what’s happened recently will continue to occur. Investors are constantly influenced by this bias: When stocks are trading higher, they erroneously believe that the trend will persist and when they tumble, they cash out and hide, thinking that stocks will hurtle towards zero. Recency bias is the reason that securities law requires that every investment disclosure contain this sentence: “Past performance is no guarantee of future results.” While many gloss over the warning, they do so at their own peril–these investors may chase performance, ultimately causing them to underperform the very indexes into which they have poured their money. When markets are reaching new highs or lows, fight this bias by returning to the reasons that you are investing and remind yourself that there is no reason to alter your plan.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.jillonmoney.com/blog/behavioral-economics-bad-investors">📄 Behavioral Economics or Why We’re Bad Investors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Schlesinger suggests that recency bias is a big reason why an active investment strategy (one in which individual investors or managers try to actively buy and sell investments in order to make the most money) does more poorly overall than a passive investment strategy (one in which investors purchase index funds and just hold the investment in order to achieve the average return of the market).</p>
<h4 id="framing">Framing</h4>
<p>In addition to behavioral biases, one of the most important concepts from this module is the idea of “framing.” Framing refers to the context in which we define a decision, its possible alternatives, and potential outcomes. Framing can lead us to shortsighted views, narrow-minded assumptions, and restricted choices. And these problems can have an effect on our decisions about investments (and about many other areas of our lives).</p>
<p>The video below explains the concept of framing in more detail. Please watch the video, then continue on to the next page in this module.</p>

<h3 id="financial-bubbles-and-fraud">12.3 Financial Bubbles and Fraud</h3>
<h4 id="financial-bubbles">Financial Bubbles</h4>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned a little bit about the typical pattern of a financial bubble and crisis. The typical steps in a financial crisis are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>New discovery</li>
<li>Economic expansion</li>
<li>Increased production and wealth</li>
<li>Lower interest rates; increased credit</li>
<li>Asset bubble</li>
<li>Market correction or crash</li>
</ol>
<p>There have been financial bubbles and crises throughout history. One (perhaps the first) was the “Tulip Mania” of the 17th century. The video below uses the “Tulip Mania” to help explain how a financial bubble and the resulting crisis happens. While this video is about tulips, the principles apply to all kinds of assets that develop into bubbles, such as real estate or tech stocks. Please view the video and then continue on with this page.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="financial-fraud">Financial Fraud</h4>
<p>Financial fraud is an intentional act of deception involving financial transactions for purpose of personal or corporate gain. Fraud can take many forms, such as the “pyramid scheme” that we learned about in the reading for this module.</p>
<p>The short video below is about how to spot investment fraud. Please watch the video and then continue on to the next page in this module. If you’d like more information about types of financial fraud and how to avoid it, please visit the link below.</p>

<h3 id="getting-investment-information">12.4 Getting Investment Information</h3>
<h4 id="market-data">Market Data</h4>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned about different sources of economic indicators and market data. One example is the S&amp;P 500, which is an index of the 500 largest U.S. corporations (by capital value). We often hear about economic indicators and market data in the news, but sometimes just in piecemeal form - that is, we get one or two measures but not a complete picture.</p>
<p>The link below will bring you to a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) webpage of market data. Please take a look at the page to see the indices and other types of information that are available here. While you’re on the page, please click on at least one of the links at the left to investigate other types of financial information. For example, you can research individual publicly-traded companies through the “Company Information” link or you can look up stock prices on the “Equities and Options” link. Once you’re done, please click on the “Mark as Done” button at the top of the page indicating that you’re familiar with the resources on this website and then move on to the topic on this page.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/Default.jsp">📄 Market Data from FINRA</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: You’ll need to enter the stock ticker abbreviation for any company or stock you want to research. You can find these by using a Google search for the company’s stock ticker, or you can just start typing in the company’s name on the FINRA site and see what comes up. For example, Disney’s stock ticker is “DIS” so you can find this just by typing in the company’s name.</p>
<h4 id="historical-stock-and-bond-returns">Historical Stock and Bond Returns</h4>
<p>While visiting the FINRA Market Data website you probably saw some data about the historical returns of an investment (that is, how much the investment has increased or decreased in value over the last month or year or whatever). You might have wondered what a “normal” rate of return is.</p>
<p>Having a good feel for “normal” or historical average rates of return is important in planning our investments. In particular, it’s sometimes tempting to come up with high expectations of the return on our investment so we can feel like we’re investing enough money. Conversely, we sometimes underestimate how much we can earn on our investment because we want to “play it safe” or keep ourselves from having unrealistic expectations that will lead to future disappointment.</p>
<p>According to David Blanchett in The Wall Street Journal, the average return on large-cap stocks (that is, stocks of large companies) has historically been around 7% after inflation. The average return for government bonds has been around 5% historically, but only around 2% in recent years. Of course, no one knows for sure what kids of returns stocks and bonds will provide in the future.</p>
<h4 id="evaluating-online-financial-information">Evaluating Online Financial Information</h4>
<p>You may have noticed that in this class I direct us to a lot of government-created or government-sponsored websites for information (although I use some that are not government websites as well.) There are several reasons I do that, but the most important is because government-funded sources of financial information are typically unbiased compared to many other sources of information. This is because the government is not trying to sell you anything or make a profit from your visit to their website. Many other sources of financial information are biased in one way or another because they are trying to influence you to buy a particular product or to link from that website to the website of one of their paid advertisers. In fact, some websites publish ““articles” that are really advertisements written to appear like articles and are produced by the website’s paid advertisers.</p>
<p>When looking at any content online (or elsewhere for that matter), whether it’s about personal finance or any other topic, you should evaluate the reliability of the source and ask yourself what kind of content you’re looking at. Specifically, is it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information (unbiased facts),</li>
<li>Opinion (someone’s interpretation of the facts), or</li>
<li>Propaganda (someone trying to influence your own opinion or actions)?</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be really hard to tell these apart, and often they are combined into one content item. For example, an article may tell you the unemployment rate (information), explain that it was caused by a government policy (opinion), and then point out that a particular political candidate is opposed to that government policy (propaganda).</p>
<p>One way to do a very quick evaluation about the source of the online content is by looking at the source’s website address extension. For example,.com extensions are used by for-profit companies, while.gov extensions are used by government organizations. A list of website address extensions is provided below:</p>

<h4 id="about-brokers">About Brokers</h4>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned that a “broker” is someone who makes financial trades, such as buying or selling stocks, on behalf of a client. There are different levels of brokerage services. Some levels of service, like discretionary or advisory trading, involve the broker either making decisions for the client or giving the client investment advice and guidance. This seems good, but unfortunately many brokers are not actually required to act in their client’s best interests by giving them good advice. In fact, some brokers function more like salespeople who earn a commission by selling financial products to their clients rather than true impartial advisors. As a result, investment salespeople may recommend investment practices that result in higher fees and lower returns, such as:</p>
<p>Recommending investment products with high commissions, such as limited partnerships, annuities, and load mutual funds. Recommending active instead of passive trading, since the investment salesperson may earn a commission on each transaction. Failing to recommend investing through tax-advantaged employer-sponsored retirement plans; since these are set up by the employer, the salesperson does not have any financial incentive for you to invest in this way. Recommending high-fee investment options.</p>
<p>In Module 2 we covered some guidance about financial advisors, including questions that you should ask anyone recommending that you buy a particular financial product. Please click on the link below if you’d like to revisit that important information:</p>

<h4 id="about-fiduciaries">About Fiduciaries</h4>
<p>The last concept I’d like to go over in this module is the idea of a “fiduciary.” A fiduciary is someone who is required by law to act in their client’s best interests. In other words, fiduciaries are required to provide you (the client) with the best advice they can regardless of whether it benefits them personally. A fiduciary is probably the best person to provide you with investment advice and guidance because they are required to act in your best interest.</p>
<p>Many brokers and other financial advisors are not fiduciaries. I think it’s totally fine to use non-fiduciaries to help manage your finances, but I suggest you be very cautious about taking any investment advice or guidance from them. In other words, non-fiduciaries are fine for carrying out your investment instructions (such as in execution-only brokerage services) but are probably not a good choice for providing impartial advice.</p>
<p>The short video below explains the difference between fiduciaries and non-fiduciaries. Please watch the video, click on the “Mark as Done” button at the top of the page indicating you’re familiar with the difference between a broker and a fiduciary, and then move on to the assignment for this module.</p>
