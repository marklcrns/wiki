<h3 id="money-scripts">2.2 Money Scripts</h3>
<p>One way to think about our relationship to money is to consider our “Money Scripts.” The concept of “money scripts” was developed by psychologists Bradley T. Klontz and Ted Klontz. They found that most people fall into one of four “money belief patterns” based on messages people receive during their childhood. Each belief pattern has certain “scripts” or messages we tell ourselves about money. The four belief patterns are:</p>
<p><strong>Money Avoidance</strong></p>
<p>People with this belief pattern feel that money is bad. Associated money scripts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I do not deserve a lot of money when others have less than me.”</li>
<li>“Rich people are greedy.”</li>
<li>“It is not OK to have more than you need.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Money Worship</strong></p>
<p>People with this belief pattern are convinced that more money will solve all of their problems. Associated money scripts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Things would get better if I had more money.”</li>
<li>“More money will make you happier.”</li>
<li>“There will never be enough money.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Money Status</strong></p>
<p>People with this belief pattern think social status comes from owning the newest and best thing. Associated money scripts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I will not buy something unless it is new.”</li>
<li>“You can have love or money, but not both.”</li>
<li>“Most poor people do not deserve to have money.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Money Vigilance</strong></p>
<p>People with this belief pattern are frugal and don’t like to talk about money. Associated money scripts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“You should not tell others how much money you have or make.”</li>
<li>“It is wrong to ask others how much money they have or make.”</li>
<li>“Money should be saved, not spent.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In an article published in the Journal of Financial Planning (available at <a href="https://www.onefpa.org">onefpa.org</a>), Bradley T. Klontz, Psy.D., CFP, and Sonya L. Britt, Ph.D., CFP provided this summary about money scripts and their own associated research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money scripts–typically unconscious, trans–generational beliefs about money-are developed in childhood and drive adult financial behaviors.</li>
<li>Three categories of money script have been found to have a negative impact on financial health: money avoidance, money status, and money worship. These belief patterns are associated with lower levels of net worth, lower income, and higher amounts of revolving credit.</li>
<li>Money script patterns can predict disordered money behaviors, such as financial infidelity, compulsive buying, pathological gambling, compulsive hoarding, financial dependence, and financial enabling.</li>
<li>Money vigilance beliefs, including themes of frugality, discreetness, and anxiety about money, appear to be protective factors against poor financial health and destructive financial behaviors. While they encourage saving and frugality, excessive wariness or anxiety could keep someone from enjoying the benefits and sense of security that money can provide.</li>
<li>An individual’s profession can predict money script patterns and vulnerability to disordered money behaviors. Specifically, when compared to financial advisers, mental health professionals are more likely to be money avoidant, business professionals are more likely to be anxious and secretive around money, and business professionals, mental health professionals, and educators are more likely to avoid thinking about money, try to forget about their financial situation, and avoid looking at their bank statements.</li>
<li>Once identified, money scripts can be challenged and changed to interrupt destructive financial patterns and promote financial health.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please consider what “money scripts” you have in your own psychological makeup and how they might affect your behavior in managing your own personal finances. It’s important to consider this now because it will be one of the topics in our exercise for this module.</p>
<h3 id="sunk-cost-and-opportunity-cost">2.3 Sunk Cost and Opportunity Cost</h3>
<p><a name="sunk-cost-term"><strong>Sunk cost</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A sunk cost is something that has already been spent. It happened in the past and it can’t be changed so logically we should ignore it when making future decisions. However, people often don’t ignore sunk costs. Instead, they try to make the costs “worthwhile” by making decisions that justify the costs. It’s important to be able to recognize sunk costs so that we can ignore them and make the best possible future decisions in our personal finances (and in other areas of life).</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpnxd31y0Fo">🎬 Julia Galef: The Sunk Costs Fallacy | Big Think</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="opportunity-cost-term"><strong>Opportunity cost</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>“Opportunity cost” is another important concept in this chapter. Opportunity cost is the value of the opportunity we lose when we make a different decision. In other words, it’s the option we don’t choose.</li>
</ul>
<p>When making decisions, we often consider the benefits of an option, but not the costs; particularly the costs of losing other alternatives. Being aware of these opportunity costs can help us make better decisions with our finances and with other aspects of life.</p>

<h3 id="financial-advisors">2.4 Financial Advisors</h3>
<h4 id="questions-to-ask-about-financial-products">Questions to Ask About Financial Products</h4>
<p>One very important thing to remember about financial advisors is that many of them are not required to act in the best interests of their clients. In other words, many advisors are really more like salespeople, who get paid a commission when they sell particular financial products (investments, insurance, etc.) to their clients. (That’s why in the list above Eric Tyson says that a good financial advisor helps you purchase commission-free financial products.)</p>
<p>Some kinds of financial advisors are legally required to act in the best interest of their clients. These are called “fiduciaries.” We’ll cover the concept of fiduciaries in a later module. For now, it’s just important to know that some advisors are really more like salespeople for financial products. To screen for this, Jill Schlesinger recommends you ask five questions of anyone who is trying to sell you a financial product:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How much will this financial product cost me? (For example, this might be an up-front commission or an annual fee.)</li>
<li>What are the alternatives to this financial product? (There might be something less expensive you can do to achieve the financial goal you’re seeking by purchasing the product.)</li>
<li>How easy is it to get my money out of this investment, and if I do what fees or penalties would I pay? (This question is to determine how “liquid” the financial product is.)</li>
<li>What tax consequences will this financial product carry for me? (Taxes should be considered part of the “cost” of the product.)</li>
<li>What’s the worst-case scenario I face with this financial product? (Many advisors will give you a best-case scenario, so this question is designed to help you see the potential downside.)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="occupations-and-the-labor-market">2.5 Occupations and the Labor Market</h3>
<p>In the reading for this module we learned that income is money that is earned or received in a given period. There are two basic ways of earning income: by selling labor or by selling capital. Selling labor means working to earn a wage or salary. This is the way that most people earn most of their income over their lifespan.</p>

<h3 id="financial-priorities-and-mistakes">2.6 Financial Priorities and Mistakes</h3>
<h4 id="financial-priorities">Financial Priorities</h4>
<ul>
<li>Priority 1: Get rid of consumer (or “bad”) debt - the highest-interest debts first</li>
<li>Priority 2: Build an emergency fund equal to three to six months of living expenses</li>
<li>Priority 3: Reduce expenses (and/or increase income from labor) to create a cash surplus</li>
<li>Priority 4: Save and invest the cash surplus to create more income from your capital</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="common-financial-mistakes">Common Financial Mistakes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not planning</li>
<li>Overspending</li>
<li>Buying with consumer credit (e.g. credit cards)</li>
<li>Delaying saving for retirement</li>
<li>Falling prey to financial sales pitches</li>
<li>Not doing your homework (for big purchases and for hiring people like financial advisors)</li>
<li>Making decisions based on emotion</li>
<li>Not separating the wheat from the chaff (e.g., following bad advice)</li>
<li>Exposing yourself to catastrophic risk</li>
<li>Focusing too much on money</li>
</ul>
