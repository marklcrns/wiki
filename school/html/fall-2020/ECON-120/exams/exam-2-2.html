<li><p>When calculating GDP using the production method, which of the following would you not include?</p>
<p><strong>E. Value added.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Which of the following may influence technological progress?</p>
<p><strong>D. All of the above.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The nation of Abbalonia’s GDP is growing at a rate of 2.1% per year. If it is able to sustain that growth consistently, it will take <strong>33.3</strong> years for the level of GDP in Abbalonia to double.</p></li>
<li><p>What part of government spending is excluded from GDP?</p>
<p><strong>B. Transfer payments.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>A method for calculating price changes that takes an average of price changes using base years from consecutive years produces a</p>
<p><strong>B. chain-weighted index.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Unlike the chain-weighted price index for GDP, the CPI asks how much a fixed basket of goods costs in the <strong>current</strong> year compared to the cost of those same goods in a <strong>base</strong> year. Because consumers tend to buy less of goods whose prices rise, the CPI will tend to <strong>overstate</strong> true changes in the cost of living.</p></li>
<li><p>The Internet Crashes. Suppose that computer hackers managed to crash the Internet in the United States for a week and no one had computer access.</p>
<p>This might be considered a negative supply shock because</p>
<p><strong>B. less output will be able to be produced at any price.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The aggregate demand curve will shift from any of these four sources:</p>
<p><strong>A. consumption spending, investment spending, government purchases, and net exports.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Most economists believe that in reality all the price indexes, including the chain-weighted index for GDP and the CPI, <strong>overstate</strong> actual changes in prices. In other words, the increase in prices is probably <strong>less</strong> than the reported indexes tell us. A principal reason for this is that we have a difficult time measuring <strong>quality</strong> improvements.</p></li>
<li><p>The key factors that cause shifts in aggregate demand do not include changes in:</p>
<p><strong>C. productivity.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Sales versus Value Added. In comparing a small country’s GDP to a major corporation, why is it best to use the value added of the corporation rather than its total sales?</p>
<p><strong>B. Corporations typically buy goods such as inputs from many other companies to produce sales.</strong></p>
<p>When we calculate GDP for a country, do we use the total sales of all goods and services?</p>
<p><strong>C. No. GDP only includes the sale of final goods and services produced within a given year.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Europe versus the United States. In Europe, the average resident takes several weeks more of vacation time than in the United States. Per-capita income, however, is higher in the United States than the European average.</p>
<p><strong>C. To compare the two regions in terms of true economic welfare, you would have to put some value on the additional leisure time.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>short</strong> run in macroeconomics is the period in which prices do not change or do not change very much. In the macroeconomic <strong>short</strong> run, both formal and informal contracts between firms mean that changes in demand will be reflected primarily in changes in <strong>output</strong>, not <strong>prices</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>State and Local Governments During Recessions. During recessions, state governments often will have to raise taxes and cut spending in order to keep their own budgets balanced. If a large number of states do this, at the national level, the aggregate demand curve will</p>
<p><strong>A. shift to the left since both of these actions are contractionary.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>X 15. Which Professor Is Better Off? Suppose the starting salary for a new assistant economics professor was $17,000 in 1976 and $92,000 in 2014. The value of the CPI for 2014 was 236.7, compared to 56.9 in 1976. A newly-hired professor earned more in real terms in <strong>1976</strong>, with a real salary of $<strong>70,719</strong>.</p>
<p>X 16. Policies That Promote Capital Deepening. Which of the following will promote economic growth through capital deepening?</p>
<pre><code>**B. Increased imports to purchase new flat-screen TVs for consumers.**</code></pre>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li><p>Individuals who want to work and have searched for work in the prior year, but are not currently looking for work because they believe they won’t be able to find a job are called <strong>discouraged</strong> workers. They <strong>are not</strong> included in the labor force.</p>
<p>Individuals who would like to work and have searched for work in the recent past, but have stopped looking for work for a variety of reasons are known as <strong>marginally attached</strong> workers. They <strong>are not</strong> included in the labor force.</p>
<p>Workers who would like to be employed full time but hold part-time jobs are <strong>employed</strong> workers. These individuals <strong>are</strong> included in the labor force.</p></li>
<li><p>According to the Solow model, capital deepening will occur as long as</p>
<p><strong>A. total saving exceeds depreciation.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>X 19. The “Brain Drain” and Incentives for Education. Some economists are concerned about the “brain drain,” the phenomenon in which highly educated workers leave developing countries to work in developed countries. Other economists have argued that “brain drain” could create incentives for others in the country to secure increased education and many of the newly educated might not emigrate. Explain why the “brain drain” could lead to increased education among the remaining residents.</p>
<pre><code>**D. All of the above.**

How would you test this theory?

**A. Compare labor productivity in developing countries with and without significant &quot;brain drain.&quot;**</code></pre>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li><p>Which of the following statements is true?</p>
<p><strong>A. Real GDP is a measure of GDP that controls for changes in prices, whereas nominal GDP is the value of GDP in current dollars.</strong></p>
<p>Economists divide GDP into four broad categories including:</p>
<p><strong>B. consumption expenditures, private investment expenditures, government purchases, and net exports.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Higher saving leads to <strong>higher</strong> gross investment and will tend to <strong>increase</strong> the stock of capital available for production and result in <strong>more</strong> depreciation because there is <strong>more</strong> capital to depreciate.</p></li>
<li><p>Cutting the Length of Patents. Suppose that a group of consumer activists claims that drug companies earn excessive profits because of the patents they have on drugs. The activists advocate cutting the length of time that a drug company can hold a patent to five years. They argue that this will lead to lower prices for drugs because competitors will enter the market after the five-year period. Do you see any drawbacks to this proposal?</p>
<p>B. It will reduce the incentive for drug companies to invent new drugs.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternative Unemployment Measures. An economy has 100,000,000 people employed, 8,000,000 unemployed, and 4,000,000 marginally attached workers. The conventional measure of the unemployment rate is <strong>7.41</strong> percent.</p>
<p>The best alternative measure that takes into account discouraged workers is an unemployment rate of <strong>10.71</strong> percent.</p></li>
<li><p>High Prices and Inflation. Critically evaluate the following statement: “Tokyo is an expensive place to live. They must have a high inflation rate in Japan.”</p>
<p><strong>A. False. Inflation measures price changes, not price levels.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The table below shows purchases for the small island of Renuzit.</p>
<p>Renuzit’s GDP was $<strong>137</strong> million.</p></li>

<li><p>We should be cautious in interpreting GDP as a measure of our economic well-being because it does not take into account</p>
<p><strong>B. housework and childcare, leisure, the underground economy, or pollution.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Calculating the MPS and MPC. In one year, a consumer’s income increases by $200 and her savings increases by $100</p>
<p>Her marginal propensity to consume is equal to <strong>0.5</strong>.</p>
<p>Her marginal propensity to save is equal to <strong>0.5</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that GDP is $18 trillion in year 1, and $19 trillion in year 2. Which of the following statements is true?</p>
<p><strong>A. It will take 12.6 years for GDP to double</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>X 29. Individuals who are working part time for economic reasons and would like to work full time are not counted as unemployed in the traditional unemployment statistics. <strong>False</strong></p>
<ol start="30" type="1">
<li><p>If the MPC is 0.75, then the multiplier is equal to <strong>4</strong>. If the government increases its purchases of goods and services by $15 million, GDP will increase by $<strong>60</strong> million.</p></li>
<li><p>In the short run, when prices are slow to adjust to changes in demand and supply, <strong>demand</strong> determines production.</p></li>
<li><p>Depreciation and Automobiles. Suppose you buy a new car for $28,000. One year later it is worth $22,400, and two years later it is worth $20,160. The depreciation on the car</p>
<p><strong>A. is 10 percent for the second year.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Trade Deficits: Capital Deepening or Consumption? Suppose a country that had balanced trade began to run a trade deficit. At the same time, consumption as a share of GDP increased but the investment share did not. Do you think there was an increase in capital deepening?</p>
<p><strong>A. No, because consumption, not investment, has fueled the trade deficit.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>In a recession, real GDP falls short of potential GDP. This implies that</p>
<p><strong>D. unemployment has risen, driving wages down . This results in a rightward shift of the short-run aggregate supply curve.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The natural rate of unemployment consists of only</p>
<p><strong>D. frictional and structural unemployment and is the rate of unemployment when there is full employment.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Diminishing Returns to Capital and Real Wages. Consider this statement: Since capital is subject to diminishing returns, an increase in the supply of capital will reduce real wages.</p>
<p>This statement is wrong because an increase in the supply of capital will</p>
<p><strong>D. increase the marginal benefit from employing labor and therefore increase the demand for labor and real wages.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>To cut back on expenses, Lindsey decides to eliminate her maid service that costs her $50 per week and do it herself. Annual gross domestic product (GDP) would change by</p>
<p><strong>C. -$2,600</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Housework and Labor Statistics. Suppose the government decided that homemakers should be counted as employed because they perform important services. How do you think this change would affect our measure of the labor force, the labor force participation rate, and the unemployment rate?</p>
<p><strong>D. The labor force and the labor force participation rate would increase and the unemployment rate would decrease.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Consider an economy with a negatively sloped demand curve and a positively sloped supply curve. Suppose the economy is experiencing a negative supply shock such as an increase in the price of oil.</p>
<p>Such a negative supply shock will shift the short-run <strong>aggregate supply</strong> curve to the left.</p>
<p>As a result of the negative supply shock, short-run output <strong>decreases</strong> and the price level <strong>increases</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Karl recently lost his job as a steelworker because steel imports from China are cheaper than American-produced steel. Karl is <strong>structurally</strong> unemployed.</p>
<p>Megan recently graduated from college, and she is currently in the job market seeking opportunities. Megan is <strong>frictionally</strong> unemployed.</p></li>
