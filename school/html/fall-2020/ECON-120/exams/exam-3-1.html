<p><strong>B. depreciates, and demand for U.S. exports increases.</strong></p>
<h2 id="q4">Q4</h2>
<p>Financial intermediaries reduce the risk to savers through</p>
<p><strong>D. diversification.</strong></p>

<h2 id="q5">Q5*</h2>

<h2 id="q9">Q9</h2>
<p>Bitcoins as Store of Value. Bitcoins are a new form of electronic, privately issued money that can potentially preserve the anonymity of transactions. In recent years, the prices of a single Bitcoin has varied between $400 and $19,000. From the point of view of money as a store of value, Bitcoins are</p>
<p><strong>A. a poor store of value because their prices fluctuate too much.</strong></p>
<h2 id="q10">Q10</h2>
<p>Why might entrepreneurs and firms use banks for loans instead of going directly to savers?</p>
<p><strong>D. All of the above.</strong></p>
<h2 id="q11">Q11</h2>
<p>Reducing Payroll Taxes as a Stimulus Policy. One part of President Obama’s stimulus policy was to reduce payroll taxes paid by individuals.   The theory is that this would put more money in the hands of workers and lead to higher spending. For this policy to work, it assumes that workers will <strong>spend</strong> any additional income, thereby <strong>increasing</strong> aggregate demand.</p>
<h2 id="q12">Q12</h2>
<p>In a financial crisis like those that occurred in 2001 and 2008, the Fed can</p>
<p><strong>B. use contractionary policy to offset expansionary fiscal policy and prevent inflation.</strong></p>
<h2 id="q13">Q13</h2>
<p>The demand for money depends <strong>negatively</strong> on the interest rate and <strong>positively</strong> on the level of prices and real GDP.</p>
<h2 id="q14">Q14</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{200,000}{(1 + 0.07)^{30}} \approx 26,273\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="q16">Q16</h2>
<p>When the money supply is <strong>decreased</strong>, investment spending decreases, shifting the AD curve to the <strong>left</strong>, and <strong>decreasing</strong> output and prices in the short run.</p>
<p>To decrease the level of output in the short run, the Fed should</p>
<p><strong>A. lower the discount rate.</strong></p>
<h2 id="q17">Q17</h2>
<p>In terms of determining the money supply, the primary difference between debit cards and credit cards is that</p>
<p><strong>C. using a debit card is like writing a check, while using a credit card is like taking out loan.</strong></p>
<h2 id="q18">Q18</h2>
<p>Taxes and transfer payments that stabilize GDP without requiring explicit actions by policymakers are called</p>
<p><strong>A. automatic stabilizers.</strong></p>
<h2 id="q19">Q19</h2>
<p>The value of the money multiplier <strong>fell</strong> sharply around 2008. Thereafter, its value remained <strong>below 1</strong> until the end of 2017. Post 2018, its value came close to <strong>1</strong>. This change in the series was because the Federal Reserve began paying interest on <strong>reserves</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="q20">Q20</h2>
<p>Recessions and Interest Rates. Consider an economy with a negatively sloped money demand curve and a vertical money supply curve. Suppose the economy starts to head into a recession.</p>
<p>If the economy starts to head into a recession, the demand for money will <strong>increase</strong>, shifting the money demand curve to the <strong>right</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>C. printing currency</strong></p>
<h2 id="q22">Q22</h2>
<p>Savings and Loans and Risk. Traditionally, savings and loan institutions made loans only for home mortgages and held on to those mortgages. At one point, this was viewed as a safe way of doing business. However, this became a risky way of doing business for U.S. savings and loans in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Why would making loans only for housing and holding on to the mortgages be very risky?</p>
<p><strong>B. Because the lender would be very subject to risk and price movements of the real estate market.</strong></p>
<p>Why does this provide a rationale for institutions such as Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac?</p>
<p><strong>B. Because they take mortgages and separate them into assets that can be part of a diversified portfolio.</strong></p>

<p><strong>C. lags and the inability to accurately forecast aspects of the economy.</strong></p>
<h2 id="q26">Q26</h2>
<p>The economist who coined the phrase “animal spirits” to refer to investment spending by firms was  </p>
<p><strong>C. John Maynard Keynes.</strong></p>
<h2 id="q27">Q27</h2>
<p>Greek Cash Euro Holdings. “Greeks have increased their holdings of euros in cash because they have great faith in the monetary system of Europe.”</p>
<p>This quote is <strong>not accurate</strong>. The reason that the Greeks held cash in euros is because they</p>
<p><strong>A. thought that Greece might exit the system and the older Greek currency would have less value.</strong></p>
<h2 id="q28">Q28</h2>
<p>…</p>
<h2 id="q29">Q29</h2>
<p>During a recession, policymakers should</p>

<h2 id="q31">Q31</h2>

<p>They could do this by raising taxes on oil if the price fell below $50.</p>
<p>By keeping the price of oil high, firms would have an incentive to invest in energy-saving technologies. <strong>True</strong></p>
<h2 id="q32">Q32</h2>
<p>For the Fed, which lag tends to be shorter?</p>
<p><strong>B. inside lags</strong></p>
<h2 id="q33">Q33</h2>
<p>Money market mutual funds are hard to classify in a definition of money because they are only held to facilitate transactions.</p>
<p><strong>A. True</strong></p>
<h2 id="q34">Q34</h2>
<p>Just Raise Taxes? As the population ages and entitlement spending on Social Security and Medicare increase, some have argued that we should just raise taxes to pay for them.</p>
<p>The main argument against this solution is that the level of entitlements as a fraction of GDP is predicted to</p>
<p><strong>A. rise so high that raising taxes would dramatically increase the tax burden on the economy and impede economic growth.</strong></p>
