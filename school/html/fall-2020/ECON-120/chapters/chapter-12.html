<p><strong>The housing market is a perfect example of the close links between investment and finance.</strong></p>
<p>With the stock market falling sharply in 2000, housing looked like an alternative and attractive investment. Interest rates were low and homeowners and potential investors found that it was easy to borrow money to purchase new or larger homes. Wall Street and government agencies developed ever more complex ways to pour money into the housing market, and banks and finance companies did not seem to be asking too many questions about their borrowers. As housing prices continued to rise, the building industry responded to the general euphoria. Investment in residential housing increased 40 percent in real terms from 2000 to 2006.</p>
<p>It was too good to last. With all the new construction, the increased supply of housing stopped the rise in prices. Some buyers made foolish decisions and took on loans that were too large for their incomes. As financial markets became nervous, lenders became more cautious and sharply cut back on funds available to the market. With increased supply and reduced demand, housing prices began to fall. The building industry recognized it had too many new houses in the pipeline and began to cut back. From its peak in the first quarter of 2006 to the fourth quarter of 2009, new housing construction fell by 53 percent. The fall in residential housing alone brought down real GDP by 3 percent and devastated many state economies. The lingering effects of the housing crisis prevented a fast recovery from the recession.</p>
<p>An <em>investment</em>, broadly defined, is an action that creates a cost today but provides benefits in the future.</p>
<h2 id="an-investment-a-plunge-into-the-unknown">12.1 An Investment: A Plunge into the Unknown</h2>
<p>When individuals, firms, or governments make an investment, they incur costs today in the hope of future gains. The phrase “hope of” is an important aspect of investment decisions. That simply means that payoffs occurring in the future cannot be known with certainty. Investments are a plunge into the unknown.</p>
<p>Firms and individuals frequently revise their outlook on the future precisely because it is uncertain. These revisions can occur suddenly and lead to sharp swings in investment spending. Sometimes investors are optimistic and decide to increase their investment spending; at other times, they may quickly become pessimistic and cut back on their investment spending. To estimate future events, firms pay careful attention to the current pace of the economy. If economic growth is sluggish, they are likely to forecast that it will be sluggish in the future and cut back on investment spending. If economic growth is strong, they are likely to forecast that it will remain so and increase their investment spending. In other words, investment spending tends to be closely related to the current pace of economic growth.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is known as the <strong>accelerator theory</strong> of investment spending. It postulates that when real GDP growth is expected to be high, firms anticipate that investing in plants and equipment will pay off later, so they increase their total investment spending. However, John Maynard Keynes had another theory. Keynes said the sharp swings in optimism and pessimism related to investment spending were often irrational, reflecting, perhaps, our most basic, primal instincts. He often referred to them as the “animal spirits” of investors. It was, in part, animal spirits that led to the rise and fall in residential investment that we discussed in the chapter-opening story.</p>
<p><a name="accelerator-theory-term"><strong>Accelerator theory</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The theory of investment that says that current investment spending depends positively on the expected future growth of real GDP.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is likely that <em>both</em> projections for the future <em>and</em> Keynes’s animal spirits are closely associated with current investment. If this is the case, we would expect investment spending to be a very volatile component of GDP. As Figure 12.1 indicates, this is indeed the case.</p>

<ul>
<li>From 1970 to 2017, the share of investment as a component of GDP ranged from a high of 20 percent in 1978 to a low of 12 percent in 2009–a dramatic 8 percentage point difference.</li>
<li>Swings in investment spending often occurred over short periods of time. For example, during recessions (noted by the shaded areas in the figure), investment spending fell sharply. During booms, investment spending rose sharply. In other words, investment spending is highly <strong>procyclical</strong>; it increases during booms and falls during recessions.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="procyclical-term"><strong>Procyclical</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Moving in the same direction as real GDP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many different factors can contribute to uncertainty in the economy. Volatile energy prices are one. In general, when the future is uncertain, firms become cautious in their behavior and may postpone making investment decisions.</p>
<p>Although investment spending is a much smaller component of GDP than consumption (approximately 68 versus 17 percent), it is much more volatile than consumption. Recall that changes in the components of GDP–C, I, G, or NX–are amplified by the multiplier. For example, if the multiplier is 1.5, and investment spending initially falls by 1 percent of GDP, then GDP will fall by 1.5 percent. However, if the fall in GDP makes firms more pessimistic, they may cut investment even further. This further cut in investment will decrease GDP even more. That is, a small initial fall in investment can trigger a much larger fall in GDP. Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson described this phenomenon of investment volatility by developing the multiplier-accelerator model. The multiplier-accelerator model showed that a downturn in real GDP leads to an even sharper fall in investment, which further reduces GDP via the multiplier.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-present-value">12.2.1 Understanding Present Value</h3>
<p>Suppose a good friend comes to you and says, “I need some cash, badly. If you give me $100 today, I can give you back $105 next year. Do we have a deal?” How would you decide whether to accept this deal? Somehow, you need a tool to be able to compare dollars today with dollars received in the future. That tool is present value. The present value of a payment to be received in the future is the maximum amount a person is willing to pay today to receive the future payment. Recall the principle of opportunity cost.</p>
<p><a href="../../../spring-2020/ECON-121/notes/ch-2.html#principle-of-opportunity-cost">📑 Principle of Opportunity Cost</a></p>
<p><a name="present-value-term"><strong>Present value</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum amount a person is willing to pay today to receive a payment in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s think about how much you are willing to pay for the right to receive $105 in 1 year. Suppose you can earn 5 percent per year in a savings account or money market account. A moment of thought will show you that you would be willing to lend your friend $100. Here is why: If you kept your $100 in the bank at 5 percent interest, you would have $105 at the end of the year–just the amount your friend would repay you. While you would have sacrificed $5 in interest, you would have earned $5 on the loan <span class="math inline">(\$105 − \$100)</span>.</p>
<p>However, you would not want to lend your friend more than $100. If you lent more–say, $102–then your loss in interest of $5.10 (5 percent of $102) would be greater than your $3 gain on the loan <span class="math inline">(\$105 − \$102)</span>. In this case, the amount you sacrifice will be greater than what you get in return.</p>
<p>Of course, you would like to lend your friend less than $100 and make even more profit. But the <em>maximum amount</em> you would be willing to pay today to receive $105 next year, when the interest rate is 5 percent, is $100. Thus, the present value of $105 in this example is $100.</p>
<h4 id="present-value-and-interest-rates">Present Value and Interest Rates</h4>
<p>Here is another useful way to think of present value. Suppose you want to buy a new car in 5 years for $20,000. You want to know how much you need to have in your bank account today, so that after 5 years you have the $20,000 to make the payment for the car. A simple formula can answer this and similar questions. If <span class="math inline">K</span> is an amount of money at some point in the future; <span class="math inline">t</span> is the amount of time, or years, in the future until you need the money; and i is the interest rate you earn on your account, then the amount you need today is just the present value of the <span class="math inline">K</span> dollars, which is</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\text{ present value } = \frac{K}{(1 + i)^{t}}
</span></p>
<p>In the example of your friend, her payment (<span class="math inline">K</span>) is $105, the interval of time (<span class="math inline">t</span>) in which she’s going to pay it is 1 year, and the interest rate (<span class="math inline">i</span>) is 0.05. Using the present value formula, the present value of $105 in 1 year is $100:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\text{ present value } = \frac{\$105}{(1 + 0.05)^{1}} = \$100
</span></p>
<p>This is the maximum amount you are willing to lend her today to receive $105 from her in 1 year.</p>
<p>Let’s consider another example. Suppose the interest rate were 10 percent and you were offered $1,000 to be paid to you in 20 years. How much is that $1,000 worth today? That is, how much of your money today would you be willing to “tie up” (loan out) to get $1,000 in 20 years? At an interest rate of 10 percent, this is how much:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\text{ present value } = \frac{\$1,000}{(1 + 0.10)^{2}} = \$148.64
</span></p>
<p>You would be willing to pay only $148.64 today to receive $1,000 in 20 years.</p>
<p>Returning to our original example with your friend, what happens if the interest rate is 10 percent instead of 5 percent? If your friend still promises you $105 after 1 year but the interest rate is double, how much would you be willing to loan her today? Using the formula, you would loan only $95.45 today:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\text{ present value } = \frac{\$105}{(1 + 0.10)^{1}} = \$95.45
</span></p>
<p>What this means is that if the interest rate is higher, you will be willing to pay <em>less</em> for the same payment in the future.</p>
<p>Let’s summarize our discussion of present value:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The present value–the value today–of a given payment in the future is the maximum amount a person is willing to pay today for that payment.</li>
<li>As the interest rate increases, the opportunity cost of your funds also increases, so the present value of a given payment in the future falls. In other words, you need less money today to get to your future “money goal.”</li>
<li>As the interest rate decreases, the opportunity cost of your funds also decreases, so the present value of a given payment in the future rises. In other words, you need more money today to get to your money goal.</li>

<p><a href="../../../spring-2020/ECON-121/notes/ch-2.html#the-real-nominal-principle">📑 The Real-Nominal Principle</a></p>
<p>When there is inflation, economists make a distinction between the interest rate quoted in the market, which is called the <strong>nominal interest rate</strong>, and the <strong>real interest rate</strong>, which is what you actually earn after taking account of inflation. The real interest rate is defined as the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate:</p>
<p><a name="nominal-interest-rate-term"><strong>Nominal interest rate</strong></a> - Interest rate quoted in the market.<br> <a name="real-interest-rate-term"><strong>Real interest rate</strong></a> - The nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate.<br></p>
<p><span class="math display">
\text{ real rate } = \text{ nominal rate } - \text{ inflation rate }
</span></p>
<p>If the nominal rate of interest is 6 percent per year and the inflation rate is 4 percent during the year, the real rate of interest is 2 percent <span class="math inline">(6−4)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens when you borrow money. Suppose you borrow $100 at a 10 percent annual interest rate, but inflation is 6 percent during the year. At the end of the year, you must pay back $110 $($100 )$. But with an inflation rate of 6 percent, the lender would need $6 of the $10 you paid in interest just to keep up with inflation. That means the lender would effectively get just a $4 gain <span class="math inline">(\$10 − \$6)</span>, instead of the full $10 gain. Thus, when corrected for the effects of inflation, the real rate of interest you will have to pay is just 4 percent, or $4, on the original $100 loan.</p>
<p>As an example, in 2002 if seniors invested their money in 3-month U.S. government Treasury bills, they would have earned an average interest rate of 1.6 percent. However, inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 2.4 percent. In real terms, these seniors would have actually lost money during the year, earning a negative real rate of interest of <span class="math inline">−0.8</span> percent.</p>
<p>We defined the real interest rate as the nominal interest rate minus the actual inflation rate. When firms or individuals borrow or lend money, they do not know what the rate of inflation will actually be in the future. Instead, they must form an expectation–an estimate–of what they believe the inflation rate will be. For a given nominal interest rate, we can define the <strong>expected real interest</strong> rate as the nominal interest rate minus the expected inflation rate. The expected real interest rate is the rate at which borrowers or lenders expect to make transactions.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-investment-decisions">12.3 Understanding Investment Decisions</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the concept of present value and interest rates, we can use these tools to understand investment decisions. Consider a project we have to pay for today in order to benefit in the future. Here is the simple investment rule for such a project: Invest in a project if the cost you incur today is less than or equal to the present value of the future payments from the project.</p>
<p>In our first present-value example, the “project” (the loan to your friend) pays $105 in 1 year, and the present value (with an interest rate of 5 percent) is $100. Because the cost of the project is also $100, the project is worthwhile.</p>
<p>Consider a more complicated project that pays $110 in year 1 and in year 2. The interest rate is 10 percent. The present value of the benefits from this project is</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\text{ present value } = \frac{\$110}{(1 + 0.10)} + \frac{\$110}{(1.10)^{2}} = \$191
</span></p>
<p>As long as the cost of the project today is less than $191, it pays to invest in it.</p>
<p>We can use our theory to develop the relationship between investment spending and the real rate of interest in the economy. In the economy as a whole, millions of different investment projects can be undertaken, nearly all providing different returns. Consider the array of investments A through E in Table 12.1. Each project costs $100 in the current period and provides a return one period later. The returns are expressed in real terms; that is, they have been adjusted for inflation.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Let’s look at the present value of these investments at various interest rates. At an interest rate of 2 percent per year, only investment A is unprofitable. For the other investments, the present value of the return exceeds the cost. If the interest rate in the market increases to 4 percent, both A and B will be unprofitable. At an interest rate of 6 percent, A, B, and C will be unprofitable; D will be unprofitable as well if the market interest rate increases to 8 percent. If the interest rate exceeds 9 percent, all the investments will be unprofitable.</p>
<p>As interest rates rise, there will be fewer profitable investments in which firms are willing to invest, and the total level of investment spending in the economy will decline. Figure 12.3 depicts the negative relationship, graphically represented as the downward-sloping line, between real interest rates and investment. As the graph indicates, high real interest rates will deter investment spending. As an example, during the early 1980s when real interest rates rose, business investment dropped sharply.</p>

<p>In practice, firms need to take into account other factors besides interest rates in making their investment decisions. In the <strong>neoclassical theory of investment</strong>, pioneered by Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University, taxes along with real interest rates play a key role in determining investment spending. Jorgenson used his theory to analyze how investors respond to a variety of tax incentives, including investment tax credits.</p>

</ul>
<p>Should we use a real or nominal interest rate to determine whether to invest? The answer is that it doesn’t really matter, as long as we are consistent. If the future benefits of the project are not adjusted for inflation, then we should use the nominal interest rate because it takes into account overall inflation–inflation is built into the nominal rate, so to speak. But if we first express the future benefits of the investment in current dollars–that is, if we reduce their nominal value by the amount that prices in the economy are expected to increase–then we should use the real rate of interest in our calculations.</p>
<h4 id="investment-and-the-stock-market">Investment and the Stock Market</h4>
<p>Economists have long noticed a correlation between the stock market and investment spending. All other things being equal, when the level of the stock market is high, investment spending also tends to be high. It makes sense that the two are related. Consider a firm’s options when it wants to finance a new project. The firm really has three choices: First, it can rely on its <strong>retained earnings</strong>–the earnings the firm hasn’t paid out in divi- dends to its owners. Second, it can borrow funds from a bank or sell <strong>corporate bonds</strong> to the public. Third, it can issue and sell new shares, or stock. When a firm’s stock price is high, it can issue shares at a premium and use the proceeds from their sale to finance new investments. The higher the share price, the fewer shares the firm needs to sell to raise capital. This means, essentially, that the cost of the project the firm wants to undertake falls as the company’s stock price climbs. In other words, high stock prices lead to high investment. This is known as the <strong>Q-theory of investment</strong>, and it was originally developed by the late Nobel Laureate James Tobin of Yale University. In the boom of the late 1990s when the level of the stock market was high along with share prices, many firms financed large investments by selling their shares.</p>

<p>During roughly this same time period, the stock market and investment spending appeared to be even more tightly linked than in the past. Figure 12.4 plots the Standard and Poor’s index of stock prices on the same graph as the share of investment spending as a component of GDP from 1995 to 2017. Looking at a historical example, both the stock market and investment spending rose sharply from 1997, peaking in mid-2000. They then both fell sharply–the stock market plunged, investment spending fell, and the economy entered a recession. This is a typical pattern. We can also see a sharp rise and fall in both series in 2006 to 2007.</p>

<h2 id="how-financial-intermediaries-facilitate-investment">12.4 How Financial Intermediaries Facilitate Investment</h2>
<p>Households save and invest their funds for different reasons than firms. A typical couple might be saving money for their retirement or for their children’s education, and they generally won’t like the idea of their savings being subject to risk. They do, however, want their savings to be readily accessible and convertible to money–what economists call <strong>liquid</strong>–in case they have a financial emergency. Funds deposited in a bank account, for example, provide a source of liquidity for households because they can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
<p><a name="liquid-term"><strong>Liquid</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Easily convertible into money on short notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose individual entrepreneurs had to obtain funds directly from individual savers. First, they would have to negotiate with thousands of people to obtain sufficient funds. This would take a lot of time and be costly. Second, the savers would face extraordinarily high risks if they loaned all their money to a single entrepreneur who had a risky project to undertake. Not only would all their funds be tied up in a single project, it would not be easy to monitor the investor’s decisions. How could they be certain the entrepreneur wouldn’t run off with their money? Additionally, their investments would not be liquid. To compensate these savers for the risk they would be taking and the lack of liquidity they would face, entrepreneurs would have to pay them extremely high interest rates, but higher interest rates would make it harder, perhaps impossible, for the entrepreneur to make a profit. No prospect of profits would mean no one would invest in the project in the first place. In other words, society would not be able to turn its savings into profitable investment projects. Figure 12.5 depicts this dilemma. How can the problem be solved?</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-12/figure-12.5.png" alt="Figure 12.5" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 12.5</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The answer is through financial intermediaries. <strong>Financial intermediaries</strong> include banks, savings and loans, insurance companies, brokerage firms, companies that run mutual funds, and other types of financial institutions. These institutions accept funds from savers and make loans to businesses and individuals. For example, a local bank accepts deposits from savers and uses the funds to make loans to local businesses. Savings and loan institutions will accept deposits in savings accounts and use these funds to make loans, often for housing. Insurance companies accept premium payments from individuals in exchange for the protection provided by the insurance payments. Then insurance companies lend the premiums received to earn returns from investments so they can pay off the insurance claims of individuals. Figure 12.6 shows how financial intermediaries create a valuable link between savers and investors. Pooling the funds of savers to make loans to individual borrowers reduces the costs of negotiation. Financial institutions also have more expertise to evaluate and monitor investments than most individual investors.</p>

</figure>
<p>To some degree, these financial intermediaries also provide liquidity. In normal circumstances, not all households withdraw their money at the same time, so financial intermediaries can lend out most of the money and still have enough on hand to meet withdrawals by depositors.</p>
<p>But how do financial intermediaries reduce risk? They do this by diversifying investors’ assets–by not putting “all the eggs in one basket,” so to speak. Intermediaries invest (that is, make loans) in a large number of projects whose returns, although uncertain, are independent of one another. By independent, we mean the return from one investment is unrelated to the return on another investment. Consider a bank investing in a large number of projects that all together produce an average return of 8 percent annually. Each project alone is risky and could pay a return either higher or lower than 8 percent. However, as long as the returns on all these projects are independent of one another, those with higher returns will likely offset those with lower returns. By investing in a large number of projects, the bank increases the odds that as a group the projects will earn 8 percent.</p>
<p>In recent years, we have seen an innovation in financial intermediation. In the past, if a savings and loan company made a loan to a home purchaser, it would hold onto the loan until it was paid off. That meant the savings and loan could make new loans or mortgages only if it was able to attract new deposits to provide the funds.</p>
<p>Two large government-sponsored financial intermediaries, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, changed the way mortgage markets operated. They purchased mortgages from savings and loans and banks throughout the country, packaged them, and sold them to investors in the financial market. This enabled savings and loans to offer additional mortgages with the funds they received from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and it allowed investors to own a part of a diversified collection of mortgages from around the country. The private sector quickly adopted these practices as well.</p>
<p>The practice of purchasing loans, repackaging them, and selling them to the financial markets is known as <strong>securitization</strong>. Although it started with home mortgages, securitization now applies to other types of financial obligations, such as credit card and consumer debt. Financial intermediaries will often borrow money from financial markets to purchase loans in order to repackage and sell them. Using borrowed funds to purchase assets is known as <strong>leverage</strong>. Increases in leverage increase the risk that financial intermediaries undertake because they are obligated to pay off the funds they have borrowed, regardless of the actual performance of the assets they have purchased.</p>

<h4 id="when-financial-intermediaries-malfunction">When Financial Intermediaries Malfunction</h4>
<p>Financial intermediation can sometimes go wrong. When it does, the economy suffers. Important examples of the failure of financial intermediation include commercial bank failures during the Great Depression, the U.S. savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, a similar crisis in Japan in the 1990s, and the U.S. housing credit and securitization crisis of 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Great Depression, many banks in the United States, particularly in rural areas, provided farmers and local businesses with loans that turned out to be unprofitable. This worried depositors, and rumors circulated that banks would fail. Depositors panicked, and many tried to withdraw their money simultaneously in what is called a <strong>bank run</strong>. During the Great Depression, bank runs occurred throughout the world. In 1931, a panic broke out after the collapse of Creditanstalt, Austria’s largest bank. Banking panics occurred throughout other countries in Europe, including Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland.</p>
<p><a name="bank-run-term"><strong>Bank run</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Panicky investor simultaneously trying to withdraw their funds from a bank they believe may fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Few banks, profitable or unprofitable, can survive a run because not all deposits are kept on hand. The result of the bank runs was that thousands of healthy U.S. banks shut down, leaving large parts of the United States without a banking system. Many farms and businesses could no longer find a source of loans, and the severity of the Great Depression worsened. Studies have shown that the countries with the most severe banking panics were hardest hit by the Depression.</p>
<p>To prevent banking panics from happening again, in 1933 the U.S. government began providing <strong>deposit insurance</strong> on money placed in banks and savings and loans. Today deposit insurance guarantees the government will reimburse depositors for amounts up to $250,000 in each account at each bank should their banks fail. Because everyone knows their deposits are secure, bank runs no longer regularly occur. Today, most countries have some form of deposit insurance intended to prevent panics.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we discussed investment spending, present value, interest rates, and financial intermediaries. We saw that investment spending is volatile, rising and falling sharply with real GDP, and depends on expectations about the future. By developing the concept of present value, we saw how firms can make investment decisions when the costs and benefits of an investment occur at different times. We also explained why investment spending also depends inversely on real interest rates and explained the distinction between real and nominal interest rates. Finally, we examined how financial intermediaries channel funds from savers to investors, reduce interest rates, and promote investment–and sometimes malfunction. Here are the main points to keep in mind:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Investments incur costs today but provide benefits in the future.<br />
</li>
<li>Investment spending is a volatile component of GDP because expectations about the future are uncertain and ever changing.</li>
<li>We use the concept of <em>present value</em> to compare the costs and benefits of investments that occur at different points in time. The present value of a payment <span class="math inline">K</span>, <span class="math inline">t</span> years in the future, at an interest rate of <span class="math inline">i</span> is</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">

<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The <em>real interest</em> rate equals the <em>nominal interest</em> rate minus inflation.</li>
<li>Investment spending depends inversely on real interest rates.</li>
<li><em>Financial intermediaries</em> reduce the risk and costs of making investments by pooling the funds of savers and monitoring the projects of borrowers. Financial intermediaries can package loans for sale to the broader financial markets through <em>securitization</em>.</li>
<li>While financial intermediaries do make the economy more efficient, they can break down at times, causing severe economic disruptions.</li>
