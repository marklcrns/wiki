<h2 id="examining-unemployment">6.1 Examining Unemployment</h2>
<h3 id="how-is-unemployment-defined-and-measured">6.1.1 How Is Unemployment Defined and Measured?</h3>
<p>Let’s begin with some definitions. The unemployed are those individuals who do not currently have a job but who are actively looking for work. The phrase actively looking is critical. Individuals who looked for work in the past but who are not looking currently are not counted as unemployed. The employed are individuals who currently have jobs. Together, the unemployed and employed comprise the labor force:</p>
<p><a name="labor-force-term"><strong>Labor force</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of workers, both the employed and unemployed.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ labor force } = \text{ employed } + \text{ unemployed }
\]</span></p>
<p><a name="unemployment-rate-term"><strong>Unemployment rate</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ unemployment rate } = \frac{\text{unemployed}}{\text{labor force}} \times 100
\]</span></p>
<p><a name="labor-force-participation-rate-term"><strong>Labor force participation rate</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The percentage of the population older than 16 years of age that is in the labor force.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ labor force participation rate } = \frac{\text{labor force}}{\text{population 16 years and older}} \times 100
\]</span></p>
<p>To illustrate these concepts, suppose an economy consists of 200,000 individuals 16 years of age and older. Of all these people, 122,000 are employed and 8,000 are unemployed. This means that 130,000 <span class="math inline">\((122,000 + 88,000)\)</span> people are in the labor force. The labor force participation rate is 0.65, or 65 percent (130,000/200,000), and the unemployment rate is 0.0615, or 6.15 percent (8,000/130,000).</p>

</figure>
<p>One of the most important trends in the last 50 years has been the increase in the participation of women in the labor force. In 1948, the labor force participation rate for women 20 years and older was 32 percent. By 1970, it had grown to 43 percent, and by 1997 it had reached 60 percent. This trend reflected remarkable changes in our economy and society as women dramatically increased their presence in the workforce. In 2018, the participation rate for women had fallen to approximately 57 percent.</p>
<p>Figure 6.2 contains international data on unemployment for 2017 for developed countries. Despite the fact these countries all have modern, industrial economies, notice the sharp differences in unemployment. <strong>For example, Spain had a 16.7 percent unemployment rate, whereas Japan had an unemployment rate of 2.7 percent. These sharp differences reflect a number of factors, including how much government support is provided to unemployed workers. In countries in which support is the most generous, there is less incentive to work and unemployment will tend to be higher.</strong></p>

<h3 id="alternative-measures-of-unemployment-and-why-they-are-important">6.1.2 Alternative Measures of Unemployment and Why They Are Important</h3>
<p>It is relatively straightforward in principle to determine who is employed: Just count the people who are working. What is more difficult is to distinguish between those who are unemployed and those who are not in the labor force. How are these two groups distinguished? The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which is part of the Department of Labor, interviews a large sample of households each month. The BLS asks about the employment situation of all household members 16 years of age and older. If someone in a household is not working, the interviewer asks whether the person is actively looking for work. If the answer is “yes,” he or she is classified as unemployed. If the answer is “no”–he or she is not actively looking for work–that person is classified as not being in the labor force.</p>
<p>Individuals who want to work and have searched for work in the prior year, but are not currently looking for work because they believe they won’t be able to find a job are called <strong>discouraged workers</strong>. Note that these individuals are not included in the official statistics because they are not currently looking for work.</p>
<p><a name="discouraged-workers-term"><strong>Discouraged workers</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Workers who left the labor force because they could not find jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to discouraged workers, there are individuals who would like to work and have searched for work in the recent past, but have stopped looking for work for a variety of reasons. These individuals are known as <em>marginally attached workers</em>. Marginally attached workers consist of two groups: discouraged workers (who left the labor force because they could not find jobs) and workers who are not looking for jobs for other reasons, including lack of transportation or childcare.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ unemployment rate } = \frac{\text{ unemployed } + \text{ discouraged workers }}{\text{ labor force } + \text{ discouraged workers }} \times 100
\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, there are those workers who would like to be employed full time but hold part-time jobs. These individuals are counted as employed in the BLS statistics because they have a job. However, they would like to be working more hours. They are known as <em>individuals working part time for economic reasons</em>. We do not include in this category individuals who prefer part-time employment.</p>
<p>How important are these alternative measures? Figure 6.3 puts them into perspective. In January 2018, 6.68 million individuals were officially classified as unemployed. The number of discouraged workers was 0.45 million. Including the discouraged workers, there were 1.64 million marginally attached workers. If we add the marginally attached individuals to those who were involuntarily working part time, the total is 6.57 million. Thus, depending on the statistic you want to emphasize, there were anywhere between 6.68 million unemployed (the official number) and 13.25 million unemployed (the official number plus all those seeking full-time employment who did not have it). If we count those 13.25 million as unemployed and include the marginally attached in the labor force, the unemployment rate in 2018 would be 8.1 percent–substantially higher than the official rate of 4.1 percent. As we have seen, the official statistics for unemployment do not include the full range of individuals who would like to participate fully in the labor market.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="who-are-the-unemployed">6.1.3 Who Are the Unemployed?</h3>
<p>Another fact about unemployment is that different groups of people suffer more unemployment than others. Figure 6.4 contains some unemployment statistics for selected groups for January 2018. Adults have substantially lower unemployment rates than teenagers. Minorities have higher unemployment rates. African American teenagers have extremely high unemployment rates. On average, men and women have similar unemployment rates, but the unemployment rates for married men and married women are lower than unemployment rates of women who maintain families alone.</p>

</figure>
<p>These differentials do vary somewhat as GDP rises and falls. Teenage and minority unemployment rates often rise very sharply during poor economic times, as was the case in the most recent recession. In better times, a reduction of unemployment for all groups typically occurs. Nonetheless, teenage and minority unemployment remains relatively high at all times.</p>
<p>Many economic time series, including employment and unemployment, are substantially influenced by seasonal factors. These are recurring calendar-related effects caused by, for example, the weather, holidays, the opening and closing of schools, and related factors. Unemployment due to recurring calendar effects is called <strong>seasonal unemployment</strong>. Examples of seasonal unemployment include higher rates of unemployment for farm workers and construction workers in the winter and higher unemployment rates for teenagers in the early summer as they look for summer jobs.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-unemployment-cyclical-frictional-and-structural">6.2.1 Types of Unemployment: Cyclical, Frictional, and Structural</h3>
<p>After seasonally adjusting the unemployment statistics, we can divide unemployment into three other basic types: cyclical, frictional, and structural. By studying each type separately, we can gain insight into some of the causes of each type of unemployment.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate is closely tied to the overall fortunes of the economy. Unemployment rises sharply during periods when real GDP falls and decreases when real GDP grows rapidly. During periods of falling GDP, firms will not want to employ as many workers as they do in good times because they are not producing as many goods and services. Firms will lay off or fire some current workers and will be more reluctant to add new workers to their payrolls. The result will be fewer workers with jobs and rising unemployment. Economists call the unemployment that occurs during fluctuations in real GDP <strong>cyclical unemployment</strong>. Cyclical unemployment rises during periods when real GDP falls or grows at a slower-than-normal rate and decreases when the economy improves.</p>
<p><a name="cyclical-unemployment-term"><strong>Cyclical unemployment</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Unemployment that occurs during fluctuations in real GDP.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Frictional unemployment</strong> is the unemployment that occurs naturally during the normal workings of an economy. It occurs because it simply takes time for people to find the right jobs and for employers to find the right people to hire. This happens when people change jobs, move across the country, get laid off from their current jobs and search for new opportunities, or take their time after they enter the labor force to find an appropriate job. Suppose that when you graduate from college, you take 6 months to find a job you like. During the 6 months in which you are looking for a good job, you are among those unemployed who make up frictional unemployment. However, searching for a job makes good sense. It would not be wise to take the first job you were offered if it had low wages, poor benefits, and no future. Likewise, employers are wise to interview multiple applicants for jobs to find the best employees, even if it takes some time.</p>
<p><a name="frictional-unemployment-term"><strong>Frictional unemployment</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Unemployment that occurs with the normal workings of the economy, such as workers taking time to search for suitable jobs and firms taking time to search for qualified employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Could we eliminate unemployment by posting all job vacancies on the Internet along with the résumés of job seekers and automatically match them up with one another? It’s possible that such an automated system could shorten the duration of frictional unemployment, but it wouldn’t eliminate it entirely. Some workers, for example, would prefer to continue searching for jobs in their own area rather than moving across the country to take the jobs they had been automatically matched with. Firms would also still want to scrutinize employees very carefully because hiring and training a worker is costly.</p>
<p><strong>Structural unemployment</strong> occurs when the economy evolves. It occurs when different sectors give way to other sectors or certain jobs are eliminated while new types of jobs are created. For example, when the vinyl record industry gave way to the CD music industry in the 1980s, some workers found themselves structurally unemployed, which meant they had to take the time to train themselves for jobs in different industries. Structural unemployment is more of a “permanent condition” than frictional unemployment.</p>
<p><a name="structural-unemployment-term"><strong>Structural unemployment</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Unemployment that occurs when there is a mismatch of skills and jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The line between frictional unemployment and structural unemployment is sometimes hard to draw. Suppose a highly skilled software engineer is laid off because his company shuts down its headquarters in his area and moves his job overseas. The worker would like to find a comparable job, but only lower-wage work is available in his immediate geographic location. Jobs are available, but not his kind of job, and this high-tech company will never return to the area. Is this person’s unemployment frictional or structural? There really is no correct answer. You might think of the software engineer as experiencing either frictional or structural unemployment. For all practical purposes, however, it does not matter which it is. The former software engineer is still unemployed.</p>
<h3 id="the-natural-rate-of-unemployment">6.2.2 The Natural Rate of Unemployment</h3>
<p>Total unemployment in an economy is composed of all three types of unemployment: cyclical, frictional, and structural. The level of unemployment at which there is no cyclical unemployment is called the <strong>natural rate of unemployment</strong>, consisting of only frictional unemployment and structural unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is the economist’s notion of what the rate of unemployment should be when there is full employment. It may seem strange to think that workers can be unemployed when the economy is at <strong>full employment</strong>. However, the economy needs some frictional unemployment to operate efficiently: It exists so that workers and firms find the right employment matches. An economy that lacks frictional unemployment will become stagnant.</p>
<p><a name="natural-rate-of-unemployment-term"><strong>Natural rate of unemployment</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The level of unemployment at which there is no cyclical unemployment. It consists of only frictional and structural unemployment</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="full-employment-term"><strong>Full employment</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The level of unemployment that occurs when the unemployment rate is the natural rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual unemployment rate can be higher or lower than the natural rate of unemployment. During a period in which the real GDP fails to grow at its normal rate, there will be positive cyclical unemployment, and actual unemployment can far exceed the natural rate of unemployment. For example, in the United States in 2010 unemployment was 9.6 percent of the labor force. As we pointed out in the previous chapter, a more extreme example occurred in 1933 during the Great Depression, when the unemployment rate reached 25 percent. When the economy grows very rapidly for a long period, actual unemployment can fall below the natural rate of unemployment. With sustained rapid economic growth, employers will be aggressive in hiring workers. During the late 1960s, unemployment rates fell below 4 percent, and the natural rate of unemployment was estimated to be more than 5 percent. In this case, cyclical unemployment was negative.</p>
<p>Unemployment also fell to 4 percent in 2000. In this case, many economists believed that the natural rate of unemployment had fallen to close to 5 percent, so that cyclical unemployment in that year was negative.</p>
<p>Just as a car will overheat if the engine is overworked, so will the economy overheat if economic growth is too rapid. At low unemployment rates, firms will find it difficult to recruit workers, and competition among firms will lead to increases in wages. As wages increase, increases in prices soon follow. The sign of this overheating will be a general rise in prices for the entire economy, which we commonly call inflation. As we discuss in later chapters, when the actual unemployment rate falls below the natural rate of unemployment, inflation will increase.</p>
<h2 id="the-costs-of-unemployment">6.3 The Costs of Unemployment</h2>
<p>When there is excess unemployment–actual unemployment above the natural rate of unemployment–both society and individuals suffer economic loss. From a social point of view, excess unemployment means that the economy is no longer producing at its potential. The resulting loss of output can be very large. For example, in 1983, when the unemployment rate averaged 9.6 percent, typical estimates of the shortfall of GDP from potential were near 6 percent. Simply put, this meant that society was wasting 6 percent of the total resources at its disposal.</p>
<p><a name="unemployment-insurance-term"><strong>Unemployment insurance</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Payments unemployed people receive from the government.</li>
</ul>
<p>The effects of unemployment can also linger into the future. Workers who suffer from a prolonged period of unemployment are likely to lose some of their skills. For example, an unemployed stockbroker might be unaware of the latest developments and trends in financial markets. This lack of knowledge will make it more difficult for that person to find a job in the future. Economists who have studied the high rates of unemployment among young people in Europe point to the loss of both skills and good work habits (such as coming to work on time) as key factors leading to long-term unemployment.</p>
<p>The costs of unemployment are not simply financial. In our society, a person’s status and position are largely associated with the type of job the person holds. Losing a job can impose severe psychological costs. Some studies have found, for example, that increased crime, divorce, and suicide rates are associated with increased unemployment.</p>
<p>Not all unemployment lasts a long period of time for individuals. Some unemployment is very short term. Table 6.1 shows the percent of unemployed by the duration or length of unemployment.</p>

<h2 id="the-consumer-price-index-and-the-cost-of-living">6.4 The Consumer Price Index and the Cost of Living</h2>
<p>Suppose you were reading a book written in 1964 in which the main character received a starting salary of $5,000. Was that a high or low salary back then? To answer that, we need to know what $5,000 could purchase. Or, to put it another way, we need to know the value of the dollar–what a dollar would actually buy–in 1964. Only then could we begin to know whether this was a high or low salary.</p>
<p>Or take another example. In 1976, a new starting professor in economics received a salary of $15,000. In 2010, at the same university, a new starting professor received $90,000. Prices, of course, had risen in these 30 years, along with salaries. Which starting professor had the better deal?</p>
<p>These examples are illustrations of one of our five principles of economics, the real-nominal principle.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="chapter-5.html#real-nominal-principle-term">📑 Real-Nominal Principle</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="consumer-price-index-term"><strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>A price index that measures the cost of a fixed basket of goods chosen to represent the consumption pattern of a typical consumer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CPI is widely used to measure changes in the prices consumers face. It measures changes in prices of a fixed basket of goods—a collection of items chosen to represent the purchasing pattern of a typical consumer. We first find out how much this basket of goods costs in a given year. This is called the base year (it serves a similar purpose as the base year we designated for the GDP deflator). We then ask how much it costs in other years and measure changes in the cost of living relative to this base year. The CPI index for a given year, say year K, is defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ CPI in year K } = \frac{\text{cost of basket in year K}}{\text{cost of basket in base year}} \times 100
\]</span></p>
<p>Suppose a basket of goods costs $200 in 1992, which we’ll define as the base year. In 2004, the same basket of goods is $250. First, the value for the CPI in 1992 (the base year) is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ CPI in 1992 } = \frac{200}{200} \times 100 = 100
\]</span></p>
<p>That is, the CPI for 1992 is 100. Note that the base year for the CPI will always equal 100. Now let’s calculate the value of the CPI for 2004:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ CPI in 2004 } = \frac{250}{200} \times 100 = 125
\]</span></p>
<p>The CPI in 2004 is 125. The CPI rose from 100 in 1992 to 125 in 2004 in this example, a 25 percent increase in average prices over this 12-year period.</p>
<p>Here is how you would use this information. Suppose you had $300 in 1992. How much money would you need to be able to have the same standard of living in 2004? Find the answer by multiplying the $300 by the ratio of the CPI in 2004 to the CPI in 1992:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\$300 \times \frac{125}{100} = 375
\]</span></p>
<p>You need $375 in 2004 just to maintain what was your standard of living in 1992. This is the type of calculation that economists do to evaluate changes in living standards over time.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="the-cpi-versus-the-chain-index-for-gdp">6.4.1 The CPI versus the Chain Index for GDP</h3>
<p>First, the CPI measures the costs of a typical basket of goods for consumers. It includes goods produced in prior years (such as older cars) as well as imported goods. The chain-weighted price index for GDP does not measure price changes from either used goods or imports. The reason is that it is based on the calculation of GDP, which, as we’ve seen, measures only goods and services produced in the United States in the current year.</p>
<p>Second, unlike the chain-weighted price index for GDP, the CPI asks how much a <em>fixed</em> basket of goods costs in the current year compared to the cost of those same goods in a base year. Because consumers tend to buy less of goods whose prices rise, the CPI will tend to overstate true changes in the cost of living. For example, if the price of steak rises, consumers may switch to chicken and spend less on steak. But if the current basket of goods and services in the CPI includes steak, the CPI thinks the amount of higher-priced steak in the basket is the same as the amount of steak before its price increase. It does not allow the amount of steak in the index to decrease. Another measurement problem occurs when new products are introduced into the marketplace, again because the CPI measures a fixed basket of goods. The BLS will eventually adjust its “basket” to account for successful new products, but it takes some time.</p>
<h3 id="problems-in-measuring-changes-in-prices">6.4.2 Problems in Measuring Changes in Prices</h3>
<p>Most economists believe that in reality all the indexes, including the chain-weighted index for GDP and the CPI, overstate actual changes in prices. In other words, the increase in prices is probably less than the reported indexes tell us. The principal reason for this overstatement is that we have a difficult time measuring quality improvements. Suppose the new computers sold to consumers become more powerful and more efficient each year. Suppose further that the dollar price of a new computer remains the same each year. Even though the price remains the same, the computers in later years are of much higher quality. If we looked simply at the price and did not take into account the change in quality, we would say there was no price change for computers. But in later years we are getting more computer power for the same price. If we failed to take the quality change into account, we would not see that the price of computer power has fallen.</p>
<p>Government statisticians do try to adjust for quality when they can. But quality changes are so common in our economy and products evolve so rapidly that it is impossible to keep up with all that is occurring. As a result, most economists believe we overestimate the inflation rate by between 0.5 and 1.5 percent each year. This overstatement has important consequences. Some government programs, such as Social Security, automatically increase payments when the CPI goes up. Some union contracts also have <strong>cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs)</strong>, automatic wage changes based on the CPI. If the CPI overstates increases in the cost of living, the government and employers might be overpaying Social Security recipients and workers for changes in the cost of living.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="inflation">6.5 Inflation</h2>
<p>We have now looked at two different price indexes: the chain-weighted price index used for calculating real GDP and the Consumer Price Index. Using either price index, we can calculate the percentage rate of change of the index. The percentage rate of change of a price index is the <strong>inflation rate</strong>:</p>

<p>Here is an example. Suppose a price index in a country was 200 in 1998 and 210 in 1999. Then the inflation rate between 1998 and 1999 was</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<h3 id="the-perils-of-deflation">6.5.2 The Perils of Deflation</h3>
<p>Prices rarely fall today, but they have actually fallen at times in world history. You might think it would be great if prices fell and we had what economists term a deflation. It may surprise you, however, that we think you should hope <strong>deflation</strong> never occurs.</p>
<p><a name="deflation-term"><strong>Deflation</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Negative inflation or falling prices of goods and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the Great Depression, the United States underwent a severe deflation. Prices fell 33 percent on average, and wages fell along with prices. The biggest problem caused by a deflation is that people cannot repay their debts. Imagine you owe $40,000 for your education and expect to be able to pay it off over several years if you earn $27,000 a year. If a massive deflation caused your wages to fall to $18,000, you might not be able to pay your $40,000 debt, which does not fall with deflation. You would be forced to default on your loan, as millions of people did during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Japan experienced a deflation, although much milder than the Great Depression in the United States–only about 1 percent per year. Nonetheless, banks in Japan faced rocky economic times as borrowers, including large corporations, defaulted on their loans. With its banks in difficult shape, Japan’s economy has suffered. Its experience in the 1990s mirrored the experience of other countries throughout the world in the 1930s during the period of deflation.</p>
<h2 id="the-costs-of-inflation">6.6 The Costs of Inflation</h2>
<p>Economists typically separate the costs of inflation into two categories. One includes costs associated with fully expected or <strong>anticipated inflation</strong>. The other includes costs associated with unexpected or <strong>unanticipated inflation</strong>. Although inflation causes both types of costs, it is convenient to discuss each case separately.</p>
<p><a name="anticipated-inflation-term"><strong>Anticipated inflation</strong></a> - Inflation that is expected.<br> <a name="unanticipated-inflation-term"><strong>Unanticipated inflation</strong></a> - Inflation that is not expected.<br></p>
<h3 id="anticipated-inflation">6.6.1 Anticipated Inflation</h3>
<p>Let’s consider the costs of anticipated inflation first. Suppose the economy had been experiencing 5 percent annual inflation for many years and everyone was fully adjusted to it.</p>
<p>Even in this case, inflation still has some costs. First, there are the actual physical costs of changing prices, which economists call <strong>menu costs</strong>. Restaurant owners, catalog producers, and any other business that must post prices will have to incur costs to physically change their prices because of inflation. For example, they will need to pay to reprint their menus or billboards. Economists believe these costs are relatively small for the economy.</p>
<p><a name="menu-costs-term"><strong>Menu costs</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The costs associated with changing prices and printing new price lists when there is inflation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, inflation will erode the value of the cash people hold. They will respond by holding less cash at any one time. If they hold less cash, they must visit the bank or their ATM more frequently because they will run out of cash sooner. Economists use the term <strong>shoe-leather costs</strong> to refer to the additional costs people incur to hold less cash. Economists who have estimated these costs find that they can be large, as much as 1 percent of GDP.</p>
<p><a name="shoe-leather-costs-term"><strong>Shoe-leather costs</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Costs of inflation that arise from trying to reduce holdings of cash.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, our tax and financial systems do not fully adjust even to anticipated inflation. It is difficult for the government and businesses to change their normal rules of operation every time inflation changes. As an example, consider the tax system. Our tax system is typically based on nominal income, not real income. Suppose you own a stock in a corporation and its value increases by 5 percent during the year. If the inflation rate is also 5 percent a year, your stock did not increase in real terms–it just kept up with inflation. Nonetheless, if you sold your stock at the end of the year, you would be taxed on the full 5 percent gain, despite the fact that the real value of your stock did not increase. Inflation distorts the operation of our tax and financial system.</p>
<h3 id="unanticipated-inflation">6.6.2 Unanticipated Inflation</h3>
<p>What if inflation is unexpected? The cost of unexpected inflation is arbitrary redistributions of income. Suppose you expected the inflation rate would be 5 percent and you negotiated a salary based on that expectation. On the one hand, if you miscalculate and the inflation rate turns out to be higher, the purchasing power of your wages will be less than you anticipated. Your employer will have gained at your expense. On the other hand, if the inflation rate turned out to be less than 5 percent, the purchasing power of your wage would be higher than you had anticipated. In this case, you would gain at the expense of the company. As long as the inflation rate differs from what is expected, there will be winners and losers.</p>
<p>These redistributions eventually impose real costs on the economy. Consider an analogy. Suppose you live in a very safe neighborhood where no one locks the doors. If a rash of burglaries (transfers between you and crooks) starts to occur, people will invest in locks, alarms, and more police. You and your community will incur real costs to prevent these arbitrary redistributions.</p>
<p>The same is true for unanticipated inflation. If a society experiences unanticipated inflation, individuals and institutions will change their behavior. For example, potential homeowners will not be able to borrow from banks at fixed rates of interest, but will be required to accept loans whose rates can be adjusted as inflation rates change. Banks do not want to lend money at a fixed interest rate if there is a strong likelihood that inflation will erode the real value of the income stream they expected. However, if banks become reluctant to make loans with fixed interest rates, this imposes more risk on homeowners.</p>
<p>What about the loans made prior to the unanticipated inflation? In this case, debtors will gain at the expense of creditors. Creditors, on the one hand, will lose because inflation will erode the amount of money they planned to earn on the loans. But since the loans have already been made, there’s nothing they can do about it. Debtors, on the other hand, will get a deal. It will be easier for them to repay their loans with inflated dollars.</p>
<p>If unanticipated inflation becomes extreme, individuals will spend more of their time trying to profit from inflation rather than working at productive jobs. As inflation became more volatile in the late 1970s in the United States, many people devoted their time to speculation in real estate and commodity markets to try to beat inflation, and the economy became less efficient. Latin American countries that have experienced high and variable inflation rates know all too well these costs from inflation. Indeed, when inflation rates exceed 50 percent per month, we have what is called <strong>hyperinflation</strong>. Think about what an inflation rate of 50 percent a month means: If a can of soda costs $1.25 at the beginning of the year, it would cost $162.00 at the end of the year! In a later chapter, we study the causes of hyperinflation, but you can readily see that inflation of this magnitude would seriously disrupt normal commerce.</p>
<p><a name="hyperinflation-term"><strong>Hyperinflation</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>An inflation rate exceeding 50 percent per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even in less extreme cases, the costs of inflation are compounded as inflation rises. At high inflation rates, these costs grow rapidly, and at some point policymakers are forced to take actions to reduce inflation. As we mentioned earlier, when unemployment falls below the natural rate, inflation increases. Similarly, in later chapters we’ll see that stopping inflation may require unemployment to exceed its natural rate and even plunge an economy into a recession. Although unemployment and recessions are quite costly to society, they sometimes become necessary in the face of high inflation.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we continued our introduction to the basic concepts of macroeconomics and explored the nature of both unemployment and inflation. We also looked at the complex issues involved in measuring unemployment and inflation as well as the costs of both to society. Here are the key points to remember:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The unemployed are individuals who do not have jobs but who are actively seeking employment. The <em>labor force</em> comprises both the employed and the unemployed. The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ unemployment rate } = \frac{\text{unemployed}}{\text{labor force}} \times 100
\]</span></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Economists distinguish among different types of unemployment. Seasonal patterns of economic activity lead to <em>seasonal unemployment</em>. There are three other types of unemployment. <em>Frictional unemployment</em> occurs through the normal dynamics of the economy as workers change jobs and industries expand and contract. <em>Structural unemployment</em> arises because of a mismatch of workers’ skills with job opportunities. <em>Cyclical unemployment</em> occurs with the fluctuations in economic activity.</li>
<li>Unemployment rates vary across demographic groups. Alternative measures of unemployment take into account individuals who would like to work full time, but who are no longer in the labor force or are holding part-time jobs.</li>
<li>Economists measure changes in the cost of living through the <em>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</em>, which is based on the cost of purchasing a standard basket of goods and services. The CPI is used to measure changes in average prices over different periods of time. The CPI index for a given year, say year K, is defined as</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ CPI in year K } = \frac{\text{cost of basket in year K}}{\text{cost of basket in base year}} \times 100
\]</span></p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>We measure <em>inflation</em> as the percentage change in the price level.</li>
<li>Economists believe that most price indexes, including the CPI and the chain-weighted index for GDP, overstate true inflation because they fail to capture quality improvements in goods and services.</li>
<li>Unemployment imposes both financial and psychological costs on workers.</li>
<li>Both <em>anticipated</em> and <em>unanticipated</em> inflation impose costs on society.</li>
