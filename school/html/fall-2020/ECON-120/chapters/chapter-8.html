<p>Throughout the world there are vast differences in standards of living and in rates of economic growth. To understand these differences, we first need to look at the concepts and the tools economists use to study economic growth.</p>

<h3 id="measuring-economic-growth">8.1.1 Measuring Economic Growth</h3>
<p><a name="real-gdp-per-capita-term"><strong>Real GDP per capita</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Gross domestic product per person adjusted for changes in prices. It is the usual measure of living standards across time and among countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Real GDP per capita typically grows over time. A convenient way to describe the changes in real GDP per capita is with growth rates.</p>
<p><a name="growth-rate-term"><strong>Growth rate</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The percentage rate of change of a variable from one period to another.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to calculate the growth rate of real GDP from year 1 to year 2, suppose real GDP was 100 in year 1 and 104 in year 2. In this case, the growth rate of real GDP is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{ growth rate } &amp;= \frac{(\text{GDP in year 2} - \text{GDP in year 1})}{(\text{GDP in year 1})} \\
 &amp;= \frac{104 - 100}{100} \\
 &amp;= \frac{4}{100} \\
 &amp;= 4\% \text{ per year }
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, real GDP grew by 4 percent from year 1 to year 2. This also means that GDP in year 2 was <span class="math inline">\((1 + 0.04)\)</span> times GDP in year 1.</p>
<p>Economies can grow at different rates from one year to the next. But it often is useful to consider what happens when an economy grows at a constant rate, say g, for a number of years. Let’s start simply. Suppose real GDP for an economy was 100 and the economy grew at a rate g for 2 years. How large would the real GDP be 2 years later? After 1 year, GDP would be <span class="math inline">\((1 + g)\)</span> 100. Ine the second year, it would grow by <span class="math inline">\((1 + g)\)</span> again or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ GDP } [2 \text{ years later }] = (1 + g)^{2}(100)
\]</span></p>
<p>We can generalize this to consider the case where the economy grows a constant rate g for n years. How large would GDP be after n years? A simple formula gives the answer:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ GDP } [n \text{ years later }] = (1 + g)^{n}(100)
\]</span></p>
<p>Here’s a rule of thumb to help you understand the power of growth rates. Suppose you know the growth rate of real GDP, and it is constant, but you want to know how many years it will take until the level of real GDP doubles. The answer is given by <strong>the rule of 70</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ years to double } = \frac{70}{(\text{percentage growth rate})}
\]</span></p>
<p>Example: For an economy that grew at 5 percent a year, it would take</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{70}{5} = 14 \text{ years }
\]</span></p>
<p>for real GDP to double. (In case you are curious, the rule of 70 is derived by using the mathematics of logarithms.)</p>
<h3 id="comparing-the-growth-rates-of-various-countries">8.1.2 Comparing the Growth Rates of Various Countries</h3>
<p>Making comparisons of real GDP or GNP across countries is difficult. Not only do countries have their own currencies, but patterns of consumption and prices can differ sharply among countries. Two examples can illustrate this point. First, because land is scarce in Japan, people live in smaller spaces than do residents of the United States, so the price of housing is higher (relative to other goods) than in the United States. Second, developing countries (such as India or Pakistan) have very different price structures than developed countries. In particular, in developing countries goods that are not traded–such as household services or land–are relatively cheaper than goods that are traded in world markets. In other words, while all residents of the world may pay the same price for gold jewelry, hiring a cook or household helper is considerably less expensive in India or Pakistan than in the United States.</p>
<p>It is important to take these differences into account. Fortunately, a team of economists led by Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania has devoted decades to developing methods for measuring real GNP across countries. The team’s procedures are based on gathering extensive data on prices of comparable goods in each country and adjusting for differences in relative prices and consumption patterns. These methods are now used by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, two prominent international organizations.</p>
<p>Table 8.1 lists real expenditures per capita for 2014, expressed in 2011 dollars, and the average annual growth rate of real expenditures per capita between 1960 and 2014 for 11 countries. With this data, we can compare countries’ real income over time. In terms of real expenditures per capita, the United States led this group, followed by the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Japan. More representative of typical countries in the world are Mexico and Costa Rica. Expenditures per capita in Costa Rica are slightly more than one-fourth of the United States. Very poor countries have extremely low expenditures per capita. Pakistan, for example, has only $4,645 in expenditures per person–less than 9 percent of the value for the United States.</p>

<p>In the third column of Table 8.1, notice the differences in growth rates. Consider Japan. In 1960, Japan had expenditures per capita that was 51 percent that of France. But notice from the third column that Japan grew on average 3.50 percent per year during the period, compared to 2.45 percent for France. By 2014, its expenditures per capita were 90 percent of that of France. To place Japan’s growth rate for this period into perspective, recall the rule of 70. If an economy grows at an average annual rate of x percent a year, it takes 70/x years for output to double. In Japan’s case, per capita output was doubling every 70/3.50 years, or approximately every 20 years. At this rate, from the time someone was born to the time he or she reached the age of 40, living standards would have increased by a factor of four–an extraordinary rate of growth. The rule of 70 reinforces the importance of small differences in economic growth rates. A per capita GDP growth rate of 5 percent per year means that the living standard doubles in 14 years. With only 1 percent growth, doubling would take 70 years.</p>
<h3 id="are-poor-countries-catching-up">8.1.3 Are Poor Countries Catching Up?</h3>
<p>One question economists ask is whether poorer countries can close the gap between their level of GDP per capita and the GDP per capita of richer countries. Closing this gap is called <strong>convergence</strong>. To converge, poorer countries have to grow at more rapid rates than richer countries. Since 1960, Japan, Italy, the United Kingdom, and France all have grown more rapidly than the United States and have narrowed the gap in per capita incomes.</p>
<p><a name="convergence-term"><strong>Convergence</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The process by which poorer countries close the gap with richer countries in terms of real GDP per capita.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 8.2 plots the average growth rate for 16 currently developed countries from 1870 to 1979 against the level of per capita income in 1870. Each point represents a different country. Notice that the countries with the lowest initial per capita incomes are plotted higher on the graph. That is, they had higher growth rates than the countries with more income per capita. The downward-sloping line plotted through the points indicates that the countries with higher levels of per capita income in 1870 grew more slowly than countries with lower levels. In other words, the tendency was for countries with lower levels of initial income to grow faster and catch up. The graph shows that among the currently developed countries–for example, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom–there was a tendency for convergence over the last century.</p>

<h2 id="capital-deepening">8.2 Capital Deepening</h2>
<p>One of the most important mechanisms of economic growth economists have identified is increases in the amount of capital per worker due to capital deepening.</p>
<p>Figure 8.3 shows the effects on output and real wages. For simplicity, we assume the supply of labor is not affected by real wages and therefore draw a vertical line (see Panel B). In Panel A, an increase in capital shifts the production function upward because more output can be produced from the same amount of labor. In addition, firms increase their demand for labor because the marginal benefit from employing labor will increase. Panel B shows how the increase in capital raises the demand for labor and increases real wages. That is, as firms increase their demand and compete for a fixed supply of labor, they will bid up real wages in the economy.</p>

<h3 id="saving-and-investment">8.2.1 Saving and Investment</h3>
<p>Let’s begin with the simplest case: an economy with a constant population, producing at full employment. This particular economy has no government or foreign sector. Its output can be purchased only by consumers or by firms. In other words, output consists solely of consumption (C) and investment (I). At the same time, output generates an amount of income equivalent to the amount of output. That is, output (Y  ) equals income. Any income that is not consumed we call saving.</p>
<p><a name="saving-term"><strong>Saving</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Income that is not consumed</li>
</ul>
<p>In this economy, saving must equal investment. Here’s why: By definition, consumption plus saving equals income:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ C } - \text{ S } = \text{ Y }
\]</span></p>
<p>but at the same time income–which is equivalent to output–also equals consumption plus investment:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ C } + \text{ I } = \text{ Y }
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, saving must equal investment:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ S } = \text{ I }
\]</span></p>
<p>This means that whatever consumers decide to save goes directly into investment. Here is a simple way to remember this idea: A farmer produces corn (Y) and can either consume it directly (C) or set it aside as “seed corn” (I) for next year. The part the farmer sets aside and does not consume is also the farmer’s saving (S).</p>
<p>Next, we need to link the level of investment in the economy to the stock of capital in the economy. The stock of capital depends on two factors: investment and depreciation. The stock of capital increases with any gross investment spending but decreases with depreciation. Why does depreciation decrease the stock of capital? The answer is simple: As capital stock items such as buildings and equipment get older (depreciate), they wear out and become less productive. New investment is needed to replace the buildings and equipment that become obsolete.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, the stock of capital at the beginning of the year is $10,000. During the year, if there were $1,000 in gross investment and $400 in depreciation, the capital stock at the end of the year would be $10,600 <span class="math inline">\((=\$10,000 + \$1000 - \$400)\)</span>.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to picture a bathtub. The level of water in the bathtub (the stock of capital) depends on the flow of water into the bathtub through the input faucet (gross investment) minus the flow of water out of the bathtub down the drain (depreciation). As long as the flow in exceeds the flow out, the water level in the bathtub (the stock of capital) will increase.</p>
<p>Higher saving, which leads to higher gross investment, will therefore tend to increase the stock of capital available for production. As the stock of capital grows, however, there typically will be more depreciation because there is more capital (building and equipment) to depreciate. It is the difference between gross investment and depreciation–net investment–that ultimately determines the change in the stock of capital for the economy, the level of real wages, and output. In our example, net investment is <span class="math inline">\(\$1,000 - \$400 = \$600\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-population-growth-government-and-trade-affect-capital-deepening">8.2.2 How Do Population Growth, Government, and Trade Affect Capital Deepening?</h3>
<p>So far, we’ve considered the simplest economy. Let’s consider a more realistic economy that includes population growth, a government, and trade.</p>
<p>First, consider the effects of population growth: A larger labor force will allow the economy to produce more total output. However, with a fixed amount of capital and an increasing labor force, the amount of capital per worker will be less. With less capital per worker, output per worker will also be less because each worker has fewer machines to use. This is an illustration of the principle of diminishing returns.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../spring-2020/ECON-121/notes/ch-2.html#the-principle-of-diminishing-returns">⚓ The Principle of diminishing returns</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Consider India, the world’s second most populous country, with over a billion people. Although India has a large labor force, its amount of capital per worker is low. With sharp diminishing returns to labor, per capita output in India is low, only $5,350 per person in 2013.</p>
<p>The government can affect the process of capital deepening in several ways through its policies of spending and taxation. Suppose the government taxed its citizens so that it could fight a war, pay its legislators higher salaries, or give foreign aid to needy countries–in other words, to engage in government consumption spending. The higher taxes will reduce total income. If consumers save a fixed fraction of their income, total private savings (savings from the nongovernmental sector) will fall. This taxation drains the private sector of savings that would have been used for capital deepening.</p>
<p>Now suppose the government took all the extra tax revenues and invested them in valuable infrastructure, such as roads, buildings, and airports. These infrastructure investments add to the capital stock. We illustrate this idea in Figure 8.4. If consumers were saving 20 percent of their incomes and the government collected $100 in taxes from each taxpayer, private saving and investment would fall by $20 per taxpayer, but government investment in the infrastructure would increase by a full $100 per taxpayer. In other words, the government “forces” consumers (by taxing them) to invest an additional $80 in infrastructure that they otherwise wouldn’t invest. The net result is an increase in total social investment (private plus government) of $80 per taxpayer.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-8/figure-8.4.png" alt="Figure 8.4" /><figcaption>Figure 8.4</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally, the foreign sector can affect capital deepening. The United States, Canada, and Australia built their vast railroad systems in the nineteenth century by running trade deficits–selling fewer goods and services to the rest of the world than they were buying–and financing this gap by borrowing. This enabled them to purchase the large amount of capital needed to build their rail networks and grow at more rapid rates by deepening capital. Eventually, these economies had to pay back the funds they had borrowed from abroad by running trade surpluses–selling more goods and services to the rest of the world than they were buying from abroad. But because economic growth had increased their GDP and wealth, the three countries were able to afford to pay back the borrowed funds. Therefore, this approach to financing deepening capital was a reasonable strategy for them to pursue.</p>
<p>Not all trade deficits promote capital deepening, however. Suppose a country runs a trade deficit because it wants to buy more consumer goods. The country would be borrowing from abroad, but there would be no additional capital deepening–just additional consumption spending. When the country is forced to pay back the funds, there will be no additional GDP to help foot the bill. To fund current consumption, the country will be poorer in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-key-role-of-technological-progress">8.3 The Key Role of Technological Progress</h2>
<p>The other mechanism affecting economic growth is technological progress. Economists use the term technological progress in a very specific way: It means an economy operates more efficiently by producing more output without using any more inputs.</p>
<p>In practice, technological progress can take many forms. The invention of the light bulb made it possible to read and work indoors at night, the invention of the thermometer assisted doctors and nurses in their diagnoses, and the invention of disposable diapers made life easier at home. All these examples–and you could provide many more–enable society to produce more output without more labor or more capital. With higher output per person, we enjoy a higher standard of living.</p>
<p>We can think of technological progress as the birth of new ideas. These new ideas enable us to rearrange our economic affairs and become more productive. Not all technological innovations are necessarily major scientific breakthroughs; some are much more basic. An employee of a soft-drink company who discovers a new and popular flavor for a soft drink is engaged in technological progress, just like scientists and engineers. Even simple, commonsense ideas from workers or managers can help a business use its capital and labor more efficiently to deliver a better product to consumers at a lower price. For example, a store manager may decide that rearranging the layout of merchandise and the location of cash registers helps customers find products and pay for them more quickly and easily. This change is also technological progress. As long as there are new ideas, inventions, and new ways of doing things, the economy can become more productive and per capita output can increase.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-we-measure-technological-progress">8.3.1 How Do We Measure Technological Progress?</h3>
<p>If someone asked you how much of the increase in your standard of living was due to technological progress, how would you answer? Robert Solow, a Nobel Laureate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed a method for measuring technological progress in an economy. Like most good ideas, his theory was simple. It was based on the idea of a production function.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ Y } = \text{ F(K, L) }
\]</span></p>
<p>where output (Y  ) is produced from capital (K ) and labor (L), which are linked through the production function (F). What Solow did was include in the production function some measure of technological progress, A:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ Y } = \text{ F(K, L, A) }
\]</span></p>
<p>Increases in A represent technological progress. Higher values of A mean that more output is produced from the same level of inputs K and L. If we could find some way to measure A, we could estimate how much technological progress affects output.</p>
<p>Solow noted that over any period we can observe increases in capital, labor, and output. Using these we can measure technological progress indirectly. We first ask how much of the change in output can be explained by contributions from increases in the amount of capital and labor used. Whatever growth we cannot explain in this way must therefore be caused by technological progress. The method Solow developed to measure the contributions to economic growth from capital, labor, and technological progress is called <strong>growth accounting</strong>.</p>
<p>Figure 8.5 illustrates the relative contributions of these growth sources for the U.S. economy from 1929 to 1982 using growth accounting, based on a classic study by economist Edward Denison. During this period, total output grew at a rate of nearly 3 percent. Because capital and labor growth are measured at 0.56 and 1.34 percent per year, respectively, the remaining portion of output growth, 1.02 percent per year, must be due to technological progress. That means approximately 35 percent of output growth came directly from technological progress.</p>

<h3 id="using-growth-accounting">8.3.2 Using Growth Accounting</h3>
<p>Growth accounting is a useful tool for understanding different aspects of economic growth. As one example, economic growth slowed throughout the entire world during the 1970s. Using growth accounting methods, economists typically found the slowdown could not be attributed to changes in the quality or quantity of labor inputs or to capital deepening. Either a slowdown in technological progress or other factors not directly included in the analysis, such as higher worldwide energy prices, must have been responsible. This led economists to suspect that higher energy prices were the primary explanation for the reduction in economic growth.</p>

<h2 id="what-causes-technological-progress">8.4 What Causes Technological Progress?</h2>
<h3 id="research-and-development-funding">8.4.1 Research and Development Funding</h3>
<p>One way for a country to induce more technological progress in its economy is to pay for it. If the government or large firms employ workers and scientists to advance the frontiers of knowledge in basic sciences, their work can lead to technological progress in the long run. Figure 8.7 presents data on the spending on research and development as a percent of GDP for seven major countries for 2014. The United States has the highest number of scientists and engineers in the world. However, although it spends the most money overall, as a percent of GDP the United States spends less than Japan. A big part of U.S. spending on research and development is in defense-related areas, unlike in Japan. Some economists believe defense-related research and development is less likely to lead to long-run technological change than nondefense spending; however, many important technological developments, including the Internet, partly resulted from military-sponsored research and development.</p>

<h3 id="monopolies-that-spur-innovation">8.4.2 Monopolies That Spur Innovation</h3>
<p>The radical notion that monopolies spur innovation was put forth by economist Joseph Schumpeter. In Schumpeter’s view, a firm will try to innovate–that is, come up with new products and more efficient ways to produce existing products–only if it reaps a reward. The reward a firm seeks from its innovations is high profit, and it can obtain a high profit if it is the sole seller, or monopolist, for the product. Other firms will try to break the firm’s monopoly through more innovation, a process Schumpeter called <strong>creative destruction</strong>. Schumpeter believed that by allowing firms to compete to become monopolies, society benefits from increased innovation.</p>
<p><a name="creative-destruction-term"><strong>Creative destruction</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The view that a firm will try to come up with new products and more efficient ways to produce to earn monopoly profits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Governments do allow temporary monopolies for new ideas by issuing patents. A patent allows the inventor of a product to have a monopoly until the term of the patent expires, which in the United States is now 20 years. With a patent, we tolerate some monopoly power (the power to raise prices that comes with limited competition) in the hope of spurring innovation.</p>
<p>An idea related to patents that is becoming increasingly important is the need to protect intellectual property rights. Information technology has made possible the free flow of products and ideas around the world. Publishers of both books and computer software face problems of unauthorized copying, particularly in some developing countries. While residents of those countries clearly benefit from inexpensively copied books or software, producers in the developed countries then face reduced incentives to enter the market. Even in the United States, pirated music and movies pose a threat to the viability of the entertainment industry. Large and profitable firms may continue to produce despite unauthorized copying, but other firms may be discouraged. The United States has put piracy and unauthorized reproduction among its top agenda items in recent trade talks with several countries.</p>
<h3 id="the-scale-of-the-market">8.4.3 The Scale of the Market</h3>
<p>Adam Smith stressed that the size of a market was important for economic development. In larger markets, firms have more incentives to come up with new products and new methods of production. Just as Schumpeter suggested, the lure of profits guides the activities of firms, and larger markets provide firms the opportunity to make larger profits. This supplies another rationale for free trade. With free trade, markets are larger, and there is more incentive to engage in technological progress.</p>
<h3 id="induced-innovations">8.4.4 Induced Innovations</h3>
<p>Some economists have emphasized that innovations come about through inventive activity designed specifically to reduce costs. This is known as induced innovation. For example, during the nineteenth century in the United States, the largest single cost in agriculture was wages. Ingenious farmers and inventors came up with many different machines and methods to cut back on the amount of labor required.</p>
<h3 id="education-human-capital-and-the-accumulation-of-knowledge">8.4.5 Education, Human Capital, and the Accumulation of Knowledge</h3>
<p>Education can contribute to economic growth in two ways. First, the increased knowledge and skills of people complement our current investments in physical capital. Second, education can enable the workforce in an economy to use its skills to develop new ideas or to copy ideas or import them from abroad. Consider a developing country today. In principle, it has at its disposal the vast accumulated knowledge of the developed economies. But using this knowledge probably requires a skilled workforce–one reason why many developing countries send their best students to educational institutions in developed countries.</p>
<p>Increasing knowledge and skills are part of human capital–an investment in human beings. Human capital is as important, maybe even more important, than physical capital. Many economists, including Nobel Laureate Gary Becker of the University of Chicago, have studied human capital in detail.</p>
<p>Human capital theory has two implications for understanding economic growth. First, not all labor is equal. When economists measure the labor input in a country, they must adjust for differing levels of education. These levels of education reflect past investments in education and skills; individuals with higher educational levels will, on average, be more productive. Second, health and fitness also affect productivity. In developing countries, economists have found a strong correlation between the height of individuals (reflecting their health) and the wages they can earn in the farming sector.</p>
<p>Human capital theory can also serve as a basis for important public policy decisions. Should a developing country invest in capital (either public or private) or in education? The poorest developing countries lack good sanitation systems, effective transportation, and capital investment for agriculture and industry. However, the best use of investment funds may not be for bridges, sewer systems, and roads, but for human capital and education. Studies demonstrate that the returns from investing in education are extremely high in developing countries. The gains from elementary and secondary education, in particular, often exceed the gains from more conventional investments. In developing countries, an extra year in school can often raise individuals’ wages by 15–20 percent a year.</p>
<h3 id="new-growth-theory">8.4.6 New Growth Theory</h3>
<p>For many years, economists who studied technological progress typically did so independently of economists who studied models of economic growth. But starting in the mid-1980s, several economists, including Nobel Laureate Robert E. Lucas of the University of Chicago and Paul Romer of Stanford University, began to develop models of growth that contained technological progress as essential features. Their work helped to initiate what is known as <strong>new growth theory</strong>, which accounts for technological progress within a model of economic growth.</p>
<p><a name="new-growth-theory-term"><strong>New growth theory</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Modern theories of growth that try to explain the origins of technological progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this field, economists study, for example, how incentives for research and development, new product development, or international trade interact with the accumulation of physical capital. New growth theory enables economists to address policy issues, such as whether subsidies for research and development are socially justified and whether policies that place fewer taxes on income earned from investment will spur economic growth or increase economic welfare. Current research in economic growth now takes place within a broad framework that includes explanations of technological progress. As an example, new growth theory suggests that investment in comprehensive education in a developing country will lead to permanent increases in the rate of technological progress, as the workforce will be better able to incorporate new ideas and technologies into the workplace.</p>
<p>New growth theory also suggests that any social factor influencing the willingness of individuals to pursue technological advancement will be a key to understanding economic growth. Can cultural factors also play a role? Historical sociologist Max Weber argued that changes in religious beliefs could help us understand growth, as he emphasized how the rise of Protestantism, with its emphasis on the individual, set the stage for the Industrial Revolution in Europe. This thesis has always been controversial because the links between changes in religious beliefs and changes in economic or other behaviors are not well understood. More recently, Professor Gregory Clark has emphasized how the growth of middle-class values in England could possibly explain why the Industrial Revolution began there.</p>
<h2 id="a-key-governmental-role-providing-the-correct-incentives-and-property-rights">8.5 A Key Governmental Role: Providing the Correct Incentives and Property Rights</h2>
<p>As we discussed in Chapter 3, governments play a critical role in a market economy. They must enforce the rules of the market economy, using police powers to ensure that contracts are upheld, individual property rights are enforced, and firms can enter safely into economic transactions. Although we may take these features of our economy for granted, not all countries enjoy the benefits of clear enforcement of property rights.</p>
<p>Clear property rights are, unfortunately, lacking in many developing countries throughout the world. As many economists have argued, their absence has severely impeded the growth of these economies.</p>
<p>Governments also have a broader role in designing the institutions in which individuals and firms work, save, and invest. Economists have increasingly recognized the importance of these institutions in determining economic growth. For example, the residents of Hong Kong link their rapid economic growth to free and open institutions that provide the right incentives for technological innovations. They wanted to preserve these institutions after they officially became part of China in 1997 and have worked hard to maintain an open society.</p>
<p>But for many countries, growth has been more elusive. For many years, international organizations such as the World Bank—a consortium of countries created to promote development—have tried a variety of diverse methods to assist developing countries. These have included increases in foreign aid, infusions of new machinery, promotion of universal education, and efforts to stem population growth. Despite these efforts, some areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, have failed to grow at all.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we explored the mechanisms of economic growth. Although economists do not have a complete understanding of what leads to growth, they regard increases in capital per worker, technological progress, human capital, and governmental institutions as key factors. Here are the main points to remember:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Per capita</em> GDP varies greatly throughout the world. There is debate about whether poorer countries in the world are converging in per capita incomes to richer countries.</li>
<li>Economies grow through two basic mechanisms: <em>capital deepening</em> and <em>technological progress</em>. Capital deepening is an increase in capital per worker. Technological progress is an increase in output with no additional increases in inputs.</li>
<li>Ongoing technological progress will lead to sustained economic growth.</li>
<li>Various theories try to explain the origins of technological progress and determine how we can promote it. They include spending on research and development, <em>creative destruction</em>, the scale of the market, induced inventions, and education and the accumulation of knowledge, including investments in human capital.</li>
<li>Governments can play a key role in designing institutions that promote economic growth, including providing secure property rights.</li>
