<p><strong>Are all recessions alike?</strong></p>
<p>Recessions are downturns in an economy that affect virtually all sectors of the economy. We want to avoid recessions, but in order to do so, we need to understand them. One complicating factor is that recessions are not all alike. Not all recessions have the same characteristics and causes. Both during the Great Depression and the 2007 recession, there were massive failures of financial institutions. In the 1970s, oil price increases caused the recessions. In the 1980s, our government created a recession to bring down inflation. And in the late 1990s, a stock market bubble in technology stocks eventually led to a downturn in investment. Understanding why recessions occur is important for diagnosing policies to cure them.</p>
<h2 id="sticky-prices-and-their-macroeconomic-consequences">9.1 Sticky Prices and Their Macroeconomic Consequences</h2>
<p>Led by Keynes, many economists have focused attention on economic coordination problems. Normally, the price system efficiently coordinates what goes on in an economy–even in a complex economy. The price system provides signals to firms as to who buys what, how much to produce, what resources to use, and from whom to buy. For example, if consumers decide to buy fresh fruit rather than chocolate, the price of fresh fruit will rise and the price of chocolate will fall. More fresh fruit and less chocolate will be produced on the basis of these price signals. On a day-to-day basis, the price system works silently in the background, matching the desires of consumers with the output from producers.</p>
<h3 id="flexible-and-sticky-prices">9.1.1 Flexible and Sticky Prices</h3>
<p>But the price system does not always work instantaneously. If prices are slow to adjust, then they do not give the proper signals to producers and consumers quickly enough to bring them together. Demands and supplies will not be brought immediately into equilibrium, and coordination can break down. In modern economies, some prices are very flexible, whereas others are not. In the 1970s, U.S. economist Arthur Okun distinguished between <em>auction prices</em>, prices that adjust on a nearly daily basis, and <em>custom prices</em>, prices that adjust slowly. Prices for fresh fish, vegetables, and other food products are examples of auction prices–they typically are very flexible and adjust rapidly. Prices for industrial commodities, such as steel rods or machine tools, are custom prices and tend to adjust slowly to changes in demand. As shorthand, economists often refer to slowly adjusting prices as “sticky prices” (just like a door that won’t open immediately but sometimes gets stuck).</p>
<p>Steel rods and machine tools are input prices. Like other input prices, the price of labor also adjusts very slowly. Workers often have long-term contracts that do not allow employers to change wages at all during a given year. Union workers, university professors, high-school teachers, and employees of state and local governments are all groups whose wages adjust very slowly. As a general rule, there are very few workers in the economy whose wages change quickly. Perhaps movie stars, athletes, and rock stars are the exceptions because their wages rise and fall with their popularity. But they are far from the typical worker in the economy. Even unskilled, low-wage workers are often protected from a decrease in their wages by minimum-wage laws.</p>
<p><strong>For most firms, the biggest cost of doing business is wages. If wages are sticky, firms’ overall costs will be sticky as well. This means that firms’ product prices will remain sticky, too. Sticky wages cause sticky prices and hamper the economy’s ability to bring demand and supply into balance in the short run.</strong></p>
<h3 id="how-demand-determines-output-in-the-short-run">9.1.2 How Demand Determines Output in the Short Run</h3>
<p>Typically, firms that supply intermediate goods such as steel rods or other inputs let demand–not price–determine the level of output in the short run. To understand this idea, consider an automobile firm that buys material from a steelmaker on a regular basis. Because the auto firm and the steel producer have been in business with one another for a long time and have an ongoing relationship, they have negotiated a contract that keeps steel prices fixed in the short run.</p>
<p>Suppose the automobile company’s cars suddenly become very popular. The firm needs to expand production, so it needs more steel. Under the agreement made earlier by the two firms, the steel company would meet this higher demand and sell more steel–without raising its price–to the automobile company. As a result, the production of steel is totally determined in the short run by the demand from automobile producers, not by price.</p>

<p>To summarize, the <strong>short run in macroeconomics</strong> is the period in which prices do not change or do not change very much. In the macroeconomic short run, both formal and informal contracts between firms mean that changes in demand will be reflected primarily in changes in output, not prices.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-aggregate-demand">9.2 Understanding Aggregate Demand</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-aggregate-demand-curve">9.2.1 What Is the Aggregate Demand Curve?</h3>
<p><em>Aggregate demand</em> is the total demand for goods and services in an entire economy. In other words, it is the demand for currently produced GDP by consumers, firms, the government, and the foreign sector. Aggregate demand is a macroeconomic concept because it refers to the economy as a whole, not to individual goods or markets.</p>
<p>The <strong>aggregate demand curve (AD)</strong> shows the relationship between the level of prices and the quantity of real GDP demanded. An aggregate demand curve is shown in Figure 9.1. It plots the total demand for GDP as a function of the price level. (Recall that the price level is the average level of prices in the economy, as measured by a price index.) At each price level, shown on the y axis, we ask what the total quantity demanded will be for all goods and services in the economy, shown on the x axis. In Figure 9.1, the aggregate demand curve is downward-sloping. As the price level falls, the total quantity demanded for goods and services increases. To understand what the aggregate demand curve represents, we must first learn the components of aggregate demand, why the aggregate demand curve slopes downward, and the factors that can shift the curve.</p>

<h3 id="the-components-of-aggregate-demand">9.2.2 The Components of Aggregate Demand</h3>
<p>In our study of GDP accounting, we divided GDP into four components: consumption spending (C), investment spending (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX). These four components are also the four parts of aggregate demand because the aggregate demand curve really just describes the demand for total GDP at different price levels. As we will see, changes in demand coming from any of these four sources–C, I, G, or NX–will shift the aggregate demand curve.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-aggregate-demand-curve-slopes-downward">9.2.3 Why the Aggregate Demand Curve Slopes Downward</h3>
<p>To understand the slope of the aggregate demand curve, we need to consider the effects of a change in the overall price level in the economy. First, let’s consider the supply of money in the economy. We discuss the supply of money in detail in later chapters, but for now, just think of the supply of money as being the total amount of currency (cash plus coins) held by the public and the value of all deposits in savings and checking accounts. As the price level or average level of prices in the economy changes, so does the purchasing power of your money. This is an example of the real-nominal principle.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./chapter-5.html#real-nominal-principle-term">⚓ Real-Nominal Principle</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As the purchasing power of money changes, the aggregate demand curve is affected in three different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wealth effects</li>
<li>The interest rate effect</li>
<li>The international trade effect</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at each.</p>
<h4 id="the-wealth-effect">The Wealth Effect</h4>
<p>The increase in spending that occurs because the real value of money increases when the price level falls is known as the <strong>wealth effect</strong>. Lower prices lead to higher levels of wealth, and higher levels of wealth increase spending on total goods and services. Conversely, when the price level rises, the real value of money decreases, which reduces people’s wealth and their total demand for goods and services in the economy. When the price level rises, consumers can’t simply substitute one good for another that’s cheaper because at a higher price level <em>everything</em> is more expensive.</p>
<p><a name="wealth-effect-term"><strong>Wealth effect</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The increase in spending that occurs because the real value of money increases when the price level falls.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-interest-rate-effect">The Interest Rate Effect</h4>
<p>With a given supply of money in the economy, a lower price level will lead to lower interest rates. With lower interest rates, both consumers and firms will find it cheaper to borrow money to make purchases. As a consequence, the demand for goods in the economy (consumer durables purchased by households and investment goods purchased by firms) will increase. (We explain the effects of interest rates in more detail in later chapters.)</p>
<h4 id="the-international-trade-effect">The International Trade Effect</h4>
<p>In an open economy, a lower price level will mean that domestic goods (goods produced in the home country) become cheaper relative to foreign goods, so the demand for domestic goods will increase. For example, if the price level in the United States falls, it will make U.S. goods cheaper relative to foreign goods. If U.S. goods become cheaper than foreign goods, exports from the United States will increase and imports will decrease. Thus, net exports–a component of aggregate demand–will increase.</p>
<h3 id="shifts-in-the-aggregate-demand-curve">9.2.4 Shifts in the Aggregate Demand Curve</h3>
<p>A fall in price causes the aggregate demand curve to slope downward because of three factors: the wealth effect, the interest rate effect, and the international trade effect. What happens to the aggregate demand curve if a variable other than the price level changes? An increase in aggregate demand means that total demand for all the goods and services contained in real GDP has increased–even though the price level hasn’t changed. <strong>In other words, increases in aggregate demand shift the curve to the right. Conversely, factors that decrease aggregate demand shift the curve to the left–even though the price level hasn’t changed.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at the key factors that cause these shifts. We discuss each factor in detail in later chapters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes in the supply of money</li>
<li>Changes in taxes</li>
<li>Changes in government spending</li>
<li>All other changes in demand</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changes-in-the-supply-of-money">Changes in the Supply of Money</h4>
<p>An increase in the supply of money in the economy will increase aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. We know that an increase in the supply of money will lead to higher demand by both consumers and firms. At any given price level, a higher supply of money will mean more consumer wealth and an increased demand for goods and services. A decrease in the supply of money will decrease aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the left.</p>
<h4 id="changes-in-taxes">Changes in Taxes</h4>
<p>A decrease in taxes will increase aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. Lower taxes will increase the income available to households and increase their spending on goods and services–even though the price level in the economy hasn’t changed. An increase in taxes will decrease aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the left. Higher taxes will decrease the income available to households and decrease their spending.</p>
<h4 id="changes-in-government-spending">Changes in Government Spending</h4>
<p>At any given price level, an increase in government spending will increase aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. For example, the government could spend more on national defense or on interstate highways. Because the government is a source of demand for goods and services, higher government spending naturally leads to an increase in total demand for goods and services. Similarly, decreases in government spending will decrease aggregate demand and shift the curve to the left.</p>
<h4 id="all-other-changes-in-demand">All Other Changes in Demand</h4>
<p>Any change in demand from households, firms, or the foreign sector will also change aggregate demand. For example, if the Chinese economy expands very rapidly and Chinese citizens buy more U.S. goods, U.S. aggregate demand will increase. Or, if U.S. households decide they want to spend more, consumption will increase and aggregate demand will increase. Expectations about the future also matter. For example, if firms become optimistic about the future and increase their investment spending, aggregate demand will also increase. However, if firms become pessimistic, they will cut their investment spending and aggregate demand will fall.</p>
<p>When we discuss factors that shift aggregate demand, we must not include any changes in the demand for goods and services that arise from movements in the price level. <strong>Changes in aggregate demand that accompany changes in the price level are already included in the curve and do not shift the curve</strong>. The increase in consumer spending that occurs when the price level falls from the wealth effect, the interest rate effect, and the international trade effect is already in the curve and does not shift it.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-multiplier-makes-the-shift-bigger">9.2.5 How the Multiplier Makes the Shift Bigger</h3>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the shift in the aggregate demand curve and see how far changes really make the curve shift. Suppose the government increases its spending on goods and services by $10 billion. You might think the aggregate demand curve would shift to the right by $10 billion, reflecting the increase in demand for these goods and services. Initially, the shift will be precisely $10 billion. In Figure 9.3, this is depicted by the shift (at a given price level) from a to b. But after a brief period of time, total aggregate demand will increase by more than $10 billion. In Figure 9.3, the total shift in the aggregate demand curve is shown by the larger movement from a to c. The ratio of the total shift in aggregate demand to the initial shift in aggregate demand is known as the <strong>multiplier</strong>.</p>
<p><a name="multiplier-term"><strong>Multiplier</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The ratio of the total shift in aggregate demand to the shift in aggregate demand.</li>
</ul>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Why does the aggregate demand curve shift more than the initial increase in desired spending? The logic goes back to the ideas of economist John Maynard Keynes. Here’s how it works: Keynes believed that as government spending increases and the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, output will subsequently increase, too. As we saw with the circular flow in Chapter 5, increased output also means increased income for households, as firms pay households for their labor and for supplying other factors of production. Typically, households will wish to spend, or consume, part of that income, which will further increase aggregate demand. It is this additional spending by consumers, over and above what the government has already spent, that causes the further shift in the aggregate demand curve.</p>
<p>The basic idea of how the multiplier works in an economy is simple. Let’s say the government invests $10 million to renovate a federal court building. Initially, total spending in the economy increases by this $10 million paid to a private construction firm. The construction workers and owners are paid $10 million for their work. Suppose the owners and workers spend $6 million of their income on new cars (although, as we will see, it does not really matter what they spend it on). To meet the increased demand for new cars, automobile producers will expand their production and earn an additional $6 million in wages and profits. They, in turn, will spend part of this additional income–let’s say, $3.6 million–on televisions. The workers and owners who produce televisions will then spend part of the $3.6 million they earn, and so on.</p>
<p>To take a closer look at this process, we first need to look more carefully at the behavior of consumers and how their behavior helps to determine the level of aggregate demand. Economists have found that consumer spending depends on the level of income in the economy. When consumers have more income, they want to purchase more goods and services. The relationship between the level of income and consumer spending is known as the <strong>consumption function</strong>:</p>
<p><a name="consumption-function-term"><strong>Consumption function</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The relationship between consumption spending and the level of income.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
C = C_{a} + by
\]</span></p>
<p>where consumption spending, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, has two parts. The first part, <span class="math inline">\(C_{a}\)</span>, is a constant and is independent of income. Economists call this <strong>autonomous consumption spending</strong>.</p>
<p><a name="autonomous-consumption-spending-term"><strong>Autonomous consumption spending</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The part of consumption spending that does not depend on income.</li>
</ul>
<p>Autonomous spending is spending that does not depend on the level of income. For example, all consumers, regardless of their current income, will have to purchase some food. The second part, <span class="math inline">\(by\)</span>, represents the part of consumption that is dependent on income. It is the product of a fraction, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, called the <strong>marginal propensity to consume (MPC)</strong>, and the level of income, or <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, in the economy. The MPC (or <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in our formula) tells us how much consumption spending will increase for every dollar that income increases. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is 0.6, then for every $1.00 that income increases, consumption increases by $0.60.</p>
<p><a name="marginal-propensity-to-consume-term"><strong>Marginal propensity to consume (MPC)</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The fraction of additional income that is spent</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is another way to think of the MPC: If a household receives some additional income, it will increase its consumption by some additional amount. The MPC is defined as the ratio of additional consumption to additional income, or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ MPC } = \frac{\text{additional consumption}}{\text{additional income}}
\]</span></p>
<p>For example, if the household receives an additional $100 and consumes an additional $70, the MPC will be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\$70}{\$100} = 0.7
\]</span></p>
<p>You may wonder what happens to the other $30. Whatever the household does not spend out of income, it saves. Therefore, the <strong>marginal propensity to save (MPS)</strong> is defined as the ratio of additional savings to additional income</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ MPS } = \frac{\text{additional savings}}{\text{additional income}}
\]</span></p>
<p>You may wonder what happens to the other $30. Whatever the household does not spend out of income, it saves. Therefore, the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is defined as the ratio of additional savings to additional income</p>
<p>Now we are in a better position to understand the multiplier. Suppose the government increases its purchases of goods and services by $10 million. This will initially raise aggregate demand and income by $10 million. But because income has risen by $10 million, consumers will now wish to increase their spending by an amount equal to the marginal propensity to consume multiplied by the $10 million. (Remember that the MPC tells us how much consumption spending will increase for every dollar that income increases.) If the MPC were 0.6, then consumer spending would increase by $6 million when the government spends $10 million. Thus, the aggregate demand curve would continue to shift to the right by another $6 million in addition to the original $10 million, for a total of $16 million.</p>
<p>But the process does not end there. As aggregate demand increases by $6 million, income will also increase by $6 million. Consumers will then wish to increase their spending by the <span class="math inline">\(\text{ MPC } \times \$6 \text{ million }\)</span> or, in our example, by $3.6 million <span class="math inline">\((0.6 \times \$6 \text{ million })\)</span>. The aggregate demand curve will continue to shift to the right, now by <em>another</em> $3.6 million. Adding $3.6 million to $16 million gives us a new aggregate demand total of $19.6 million. As you can see, this process will continue, as consumers now have an additional $3.6 million in income, part of which they will spend again. Where will it end?</p>
<p>Table 9.2 shows how the multiplier works in detail. In the first round, there is an initial increase in government spending of $10 million. This additional demand leads to an initial increase in GDP and income of $10 million. Assuming that the MPC is 0.6, the $10 million of additional income will increase consumer spending by $6 million. The second round begins with this $6 million increase in consumer spending. Because of this increase in demand, GDP and income increase by $6 million. At the end of the second round, consumers will have an additional $6 million; with an MPC of 0.6, consumer spending will therefore increase by $0.6 $6 $, or $3.6 million. The process continues in the third round with an increase in consumer spending of $2.16 million. It continues, in diminishing amounts, through subsequent rounds. If we add up the spending in all the (infinite) rounds, we will find that the initial $10 million of spending leads to a $25 million increase in GDP and income. That’s 2.5 times what the government initially spent. So, in this case, the multiplier is 2.5.</p>

<p>Instead of calculating spending round by round, we can use a simple formula to figure out what the multiplier is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ multiplier } = \frac{1}{(1 - \text{ MPC })}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, in the preceding example, when the MPC is 0.6, the multiplier would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{(1 - 0.6)} = 2.5
\]</span></p>
<p>Now you should clearly understand why the total shift in the aggregate demand curve from a to c in Figure 9.3 is greater than the initial shift in the curve from a to b. This is the multiplier in action. The multiplier is important because it means that relatively small changes in spending could lead to relatively large changes in output. For example, if firms cut back on their investment spending, the effects on output would be “multiplied,” and this decrease in spending could have a large, adverse impact on the economy.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-aggregate-supply">9.3 Understanding Aggregate Supply</h2>
<p>Now we turn to the supply side of our model. The <strong>aggregate supply curve (AS)</strong> shows the relationship between the level of prices and the total quantity of final goods and output that firms are willing and able to supply. The aggregate supply curve will complete our macroeconomic picture, uniting the economy’s demand for real output with firms’ willingness to supply output. To determine both the price level and real GDP, we need to combine both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. One slight complication is that because prices are “sticky” in the short run, we need to develop two different aggregate supply curves, one corresponding to the long run and one to the short run.</p>
<p><a name="aggregate-supply-curve-term"><strong>Aggregate supply curve (AS)</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>A curve that shows the relationship between the level of prices and the quantity of output supplied.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-long-run-aggregate-supply-curve">9.3.1 The Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve</h3>
<p>First, we consider the aggregate supply curve for the long run, that is, when the economy is at full employment. This curve is also called the <strong>long-run aggregate supply curve</strong>. In previous chapters, we saw that the level of full-employment output, <span class="math inline">\(y_{p}\)</span> (the “p” stands for potential), depends solely on the supply of factors–capital, labor–and the state of technology. These are the fundamental factors that determine output in the long run, that is, when the economy operates at full employment.</p>
<p><a name="long-run-aggregate-supply-curve-term"><strong>Long-run aggregate supply curve</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>A vertical aggregate supply curve that reflects the idea that in the long run, output is determined solely by the factors of production and technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the long run, the economy operates at full employment and changes in the price level do not affect employment. To illustrate why this is so, imagine that the price level in the economy increases by 50 percent. That means firms’ prices, on average, will also increase by 50 percent. However, so will their input costs. Their profits will be the same and, consequently, so will their output. Because the level of full-employment output does not depend on the price level, we can plot the long-run aggregate supply curve as a vertical line (unaffected by the price level), as shown in Figure 9.4.</p>

</figure>
<h4 id="determining-output-and-the-price-level">Determining Output and the Price Level</h4>
<p>We combine the aggregate demand curve and the long-run aggregate supply curve in Figure 9.5. Together, the curves show us the price level and output in the long run when the economy returns to full employment. Combining the two curves will enable us to understand how changes in aggregate demand affect prices in the long run.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-9/figure-9.5.png" alt="Figure 9.5" /><figcaption>Figure 9.5</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The intersection of an aggregate demand curve and an aggregate supply curve determines the price level and equilibrium level of output. At that intersection point, the total amount of output demanded will just equal the total amount supplied by producers–the economy will be in macroeconomic equilibrium. The exact position of the aggregate demand curve will depend on the level of taxes, government spending, and the supply of money, although it will always slope downward. The level of full-employment output determines the long-run aggregate supply curve.</p>
<p>An increase in aggregate demand (perhaps brought about by a tax cut or an increase in the supply of money) will shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, as shown in Figure 9.5. In the long run, the increase in aggregate demand will raise prices but leave the level of output unchanged. In general, shifts in the aggregate demand curve in the long run do not change the level of output in the economy, but only change the level of prices. Here is an important example to illustrate this idea: If the money supply is increased by 5 percent a year, the aggregate demand curve will also shift by 5 percent a year. In the long run, this means that prices will increase by 5 percent a year–that is, there will be 5 percent inflation. <strong>An important lesson: In the long run, increases in the supply of money do not increase real GDP–they only lead to inflation.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-short-run-aggregate-supply-curve">9.3.2 The Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve</h3>
<p>In the short run, prices are sticky (slow to adjust) and output is determined primarily by demand. This is what Keynes thought happened during the Great Depression. We can use the aggregate demand curve combined with a <strong>short-run aggregate supply curve</strong> to illustrate this idea. Figure 9.6 shows a relatively flat short-run aggregate supply curve (AS). The short-run aggregate supply curve shows the short-run relationship between the price level and the willingness of firms to supply output to the economy. Let’s look first at its slope and then the factors that shift the curve.</p>
<p><a name="short-run-aggregate-supply-curve-term"><strong>Short-run aggregate supply curve</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>A relatively flat aggregate supply curve that represents the idea that prices do not change very much in the short run and that firms adjust production to meet demand.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-9/figure-9.6.png" alt="Figure 9.6" /><figcaption>Figure 9.6</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The short-run aggregate supply curve has a relatively flat slope because we assume that in the short run firms supply all the output demanded, with small changes in prices. We’ve said that with formal and informal contracts firms will supply all the output demanded with only relatively small changes in prices.</p>
<p>Most studies find that changes in demand have relatively little effect on prices within a few quarters. Thus, we can think of the aggregate supply curve as relatively flat over a limited time.</p>
<p>The position of the short-run supply curve will be determined by the costs of production that firms face. <strong>Higher costs will shift up the short-run aggregate supply curve, while lower costs will shift it down. Higher costs will shift up the curve because, faced with higher costs, firms will need to raise their prices to continue to make a profit</strong>. What factors determine the costs firms must incur to produce output? The key factors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input prices (wages and materials)</li>
<li>The state of technology</li>
<li>Taxes, subsidies, or economic regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>Increases in input prices (e.g., from higher wages or oil prices) will increase firms’ costs. This will shift up the short-run aggregate supply curve. Improvement in technology will shift the curve down. Higher taxes or more onerous regulations raise costs and shift the curve up, while subsidies to production shift the curve down. As we shall see later in this chapter, when the economy is not at full employment, wages and other costs will change. These changes in costs will shift the entire short-run supply curve upward or downward as costs rise or fall.</p>
<p>The intersection of the AD and AS curves at point <span class="math inline">\(a_{0}\)</span> determines the price level and the level of output. Because the aggregate supply curve is flat, aggregate demand primarily determines the level of output. In Figure 9.6, as aggregate demand increases, the new equilibrium will be at a slightly higher price, and output will increase from <span class="math inline">\(y_{0}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y_{1}\)</span></p>
<h3 id="supply-shocks">9.3.3 Supply Shocks</h3>
<p>Up to this point, we have been exploring how changes in aggregate demand affect output and prices in the short run and in the long run. However, even in the short run, it is possible for external disturbances to hit the economy and cause the short-run aggregate supply curve to move. <strong>Supply shocks</strong> are external events that shift the aggregate supply curve.</p>
<p><a name="supply-shocks-term"><strong>Supply shocks</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>External events that shift the aggregate supply curve.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most notable supply shocks for the world economy occurred in 1973 and again in 1979 when oil prices increased sharply. Oil is a vital input for many companies because it is used to both manufacture and transport their products to warehouses and stores around the country. The higher oil prices raised firms’ costs and reduced their profits. To maintain their profit levels, firms raised their product prices. As we have seen, increases in firms’ costs will shift up the short-run aggregate supply curve–increases in oil prices are a good example.</p>
<p>Figure 9.7 illustrates a supply shock that raises prices. The short-run aggregate supply curve shifts up with the supply shock because, as their costs rise, firms will supply their output only at a higher price. The AS curve shifts up, raising the price level and lowering the level of output from <span class="math inline">\(y_{0}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y_{1}\)</span>. Adverse supply shocks can therefore cause a recession (a fall in real output) with increasing prices. This phenomenon is known as stagflation, and it is precisely what happened in 1973 and 1979. The U.S. economy suffered on two grounds: rising prices and falling output. Favorable supply shocks, such as falling prices, are also possible, and changes in oil prices can affect aggregate demand.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="from-the-short-run-to-the-long-run">9.4 From the Short Run to the Long Run</h2>
<p>In Figure 9.8, we show the aggregate demand curve intersecting the short-run aggregate supply curve at <span class="math inline">\(a_{0}\)</span> at an output level <span class="math inline">\(y_{0}\)</span>. We also depict the long-run aggregate supply curve in this figure. The level of output in the economy, $y_{0}$, exceeds the level of potential output, <span class="math inline">\(y_{p}\)</span>. In other words, this is a boom economy: Output exceeds potential.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-9/figure-9.8.png" alt="Figure 9.8" /><figcaption>Figure 9.8</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What happens during a boom? Because the economy is producing at a level beyond its long-run potential, the level of unemployment will be very low. This will make it difficult for firms to recruit and retain workers. Firms will also find it more difficult to purchase needed raw materials and other inputs for production. As firms compete for labor and raw materials, the tendency will be for both wages and prices to increase over time.</p>
<p>Increasing wages and prices will shift the short-run aggregate supply curve upward as the costs of inputs rise in the economy. Figure 9.9 shows how the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts upward over time. As long as the economy is producing at a level of output that exceeds potential output, there will be continuing competition for labor and raw materials that will lead to continuing increases in wages and prices. In the long run, the short-run aggregate supply curve will keep rising until it intersects the aggregate demand curve at <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}\)</span>. At this point, the economy reaches the long-run equilibrium–precisely the point where the aggregate demand curve intersects the long-run aggregate supply curve.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-9/figure-9.9.png" alt="Figure 9.9" /><figcaption>Figure 9.9</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When the economy is producing below full employment or potential output, the process works in reverse. Unemployment will exceed the natural rate, and there will be excess unemployment. Firms will find it easy to hire and retain workers, and they will offer workers less wages. As firms cut wages, the average wage level in the economy falls. Because wages are the largest component of costs and costs are decreasing, the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts down, causing prices to fall as well.</p>
<p><strong>The lesson here is that adjustments in wages and prices take the economy from the short-run equilibrium to the long-run equilibrium.</strong></p>
<h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter we discussed how sticky prices–or lack of full-wage and price flexibility–cause output to be determined by demand in the short run. We developed a model of aggregate demand and supply to help us analyze what is happening or has happened in the economy. Here are the main points in this chapter:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Because prices are sticky in the short run, economists think of GDP as being determined primarily by demand factors in the short run.</li>
<li>The <em>aggregate demand curve</em> depicts the relationship between the price level and total demand for real output in the economy. The aggregate demand curve is downward-sloping because of the wealth effect, the interest rate effect, and the international trade effect.</li>
<li>Decreases in taxes, increases in government spending, and increases in the supply of money all increase aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. Increases in taxes, decreases in government spending, and decreases in the supply of money all decrease aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the left. In general, anything (other than price movements) that increases the demand for total goods and services will increase aggregate demand.</li>
<li>The total shift in the aggregate demand curve is greater than the initial shift. The ratio of the total shift in aggregate demand to the initial shift in aggregate demand is known as the <em>multiplier</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>aggregate supply curve</em> depicts the relationship between the price level and the level of output that firms supply in the economy. Output and prices are determined at the intersection of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves.</li>
<li>The <em>long-run aggregate supply curve</em> is vertical because, in the long run, output is determined by the supply of factors of production. The <em>short-run aggregate supply curve</em> is fairly flat because, in the short run, prices are largely fixed, and output is determined by demand. The costs of production determine the position of the short-run aggregate supply curve.</li>
<li><em>Supply shocks</em> can shift the short-run aggregate supply curve.</li>
<li>As costs change, the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts in the long run, restoring the economy to the full-employment equilibrium.</li>
