<h2 id="the-flip-sides-of-macroeconomic-activity-production-and-income">5.1 The Flip Sides of Macroeconomic Activity: Production and Income</h2>
<p>Before we can study growth and fluctuations, we need to have a basic vocabulary and understanding of some key concepts. We begin with the terms production and income because these are the flip sides of the macroeconomic coin, so to speak. Every day, men and women go off to work, where they produce or sell merchandise or provide services. At the end of the week or month, they return home with their paychecks or income. They spend some of that money on other products and services, which are produced by other people. <strong>In other words, production leads to income, and income leads to production</strong>.</p>
<p>From a big picture perspective, we look at certain measures that will tell us how much the economy is producing and how well it is growing. We will also be able to measure the total income generated in the economy and how this income flows back to workers and investors. These two measures–a country’s production and income–are critical to a nation’s economic health. Macroeconomists collect and analyze production and income data to understand how many people will find jobs and whether their living standards are rising or falling. Government officials use the data and analysis to develop economic policies.</p>
<h3 id="the-circular-flow-of-production-and-income">The Circular Flow of Production and Income</h3>
<p>Let’s begin with a simple diagram known as the <em>circular flow</em>, shown in Figure 5.1. We start with a very simple economy that does not have a government or a foreign sector. Households and firms make transactions in two markets known as <em>factor markets</em> and <em>product markets</em>. In factor, or input, markets, households supply labor to firms. Households are also the ultimate owners of firms, as well as of all the resources firms use in their production, which we call <em>capital</em>. Consequently, we can think of households as providing capital to firms–land, buildings, and equipment–to produce output. Product, or output, markets are markets in which firms sell goods and services to consumers.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-5/figure-5.1.png" alt="Figure 5.1 The Circulatr Flow of Production and Income" /><figcaption>Figure 5.1 The Circulatr Flow of Production and Income</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The point of the circular flow diagram is simple and fundamental: Production generates income. In factor markets, when households supply labor and capital to firms, they are compensated by the firms. They earn wages for their work, and they earn interest, dividends, and rents on the capital they supply to the firms. The households then use their income to purchase goods and services in the product markets. The firm uses the revenues it receives from the sale of its products to pay for the factors of production (land, labor, and capital).</p>
<h2 id="the-production-approach-measuring-a-nations-macroeconomic-activity-using-gross-domestic-product">5.2 The Production Approach: Measuring a Nation’s Macroeconomic Activity Using Gross Domestic Product</h2>
<p><a name="gross-domestic-product-term"><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The total market value of final goods and services produced within an economy in a given year.</li>
<li>GDP is also the most common measure of an economy’s total output.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the words in the GDP definition are important, so let’s analyze them</p>
<p><em>Total market</em> value means we take the quantity of goods produced, multiply them by their respective prices, and then add up the totals. If an economy produced two cars at $25,000 per car and three computers at $2,000 per computer, the total value of these goods will be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
2 \text{ cars } \times \$25,000 \text{ per car }          &amp; = \$50,000 \\
3 \text{ computers } \times \$2,000 \text{ per computer } &amp; = \$\:\:6,000 \\
                                                          &amp; = \$56,000
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Final goods and services in the GDP definition means those goods and services that are sold to ultimate, or final, purchasers. For example, the two cars that were produced would be final goods if they were sold to households or to a business. However, to produce the cars the automobile manufacturer bought steel that went into the body of the cars, and we do not count this steel as a final good or service in GDP. Steel is an example of an intermediate good, one that is used in the production process. An <strong>intermediate good</strong> is not considered a final good or service.</p>
<p><a name="intermediate-good-term"><strong>Intermediate good</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Goods used in the production process that are not final goods and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason we do not count intermediate goods as final goods is to avoid double-counting. The price of the car already reflects the price of the steel contained in it. We do not want to count the steel twice.</p>
<p>The final words in our GDP definition are in <em>a given year</em>. GDP is expressed as a rate of production–that is, as “X” amount of dollars per year. In 2014, for example, GDP in the United States was $17,420 billion. Goods produced in prior years, such as cars or houses, are not included in GDP for a given year, even if one consumer sells a house or car to another in that year. Only newly produced products are included in GDP.</p>
<p>Because we measure GDP using the current prices for goods and services, GDP will increase if prices increase, even if the physical amount of goods that are produced remains the same. Suppose that next year the economy again produces two cars and three computers, but all the prices in the economy double: The price of cars is $50,000, and the price of computers is $4,000. GDP will also be twice as high, or $112,000, even though the quantity produced is the same as during the prior year:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
2 \text{ cars } \times \$50,000 \text{ per car } &amp;= \$100,000  \\
+ \\
3 \text{ computers } \times \$4,000 \text{ per computer } &amp;= \$\:\:12,000  \\
 &amp;= \$112,000
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>But to say that GDP has doubled would be misleading because exactly the same goods were produced. To avoid this problem, let’s apply the real-nominal principle, one of our five basic principles of economics.</p>
<p><a name="real-nominal-principle-term"><strong>Real-nominal principle</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>What matters to people is the real value of money or income–its purchasing power– not the face value of money or income.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we need is another measure of total output that doesn’t increase just because prices increase. For this reason, economists have developed the concept of <strong>real GDP</strong>, a measure that controls for changes in prices. Later in this chapter, we explain how real GDP is calculated. The basic idea is simple. When we use current prices to measure GDP, we are using <strong>nominal GDP</strong>. Nominal GDP can increase for one of two reasons: Either the production of goods and services has increased, or the prices of those goods and services have increased.</p>
<p><a name="real-gdp-term"><strong>Real GDP</strong></a> - A measure of GDP that controls for changes in price.<br> <a name="nominal-gdp-term"><strong>Nominal GDP</strong></a> - The value of GDP in current dollars.<br></p>
<p>To explain the concept of real GDP, we first need to look at a simple example. Suppose an economy produces a single good: computers. In year 1, 10 computers were produced, and each sold for $2,000. In year 2, 12 computers were produced, and each sold for $2,100. Nominal GDP is $20,000 in year 1 and $25,200 in year 2; it has increased by a factor of 1.26 or 26 percent. However, we can also measure real GDP by using year 1 prices as a measure of what was produced in year 1 and what was produced in year 2.</p>
<p>In year 1, real GDP is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
10 \text{ computers } \times \$2,000 \text{ per computer } = \$20,000
\]</span></p>
<p>In year 2, real GDP (in year 1 terms) is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
12 \text{ computers } \times \$2,000 \text{ per computer } = \$24,000
\]</span></p>
<p>Real GDP in year 2 is still greater than real GDP in year 1, now by a factor of 1.2, or 20 percent. The key idea is that we construct a measure using the same prices for both years and thereby take price changes into account.</p>
<p>Figure 5.2 plots real GDP for the U.S. economy for the years 1947 through 2013. The graph shows that real GDP has grown substantially over this period. This is what economists call <strong>economic growth</strong>–sustained increases in the real GDP of an economy over a long period of time.</p>

<h3 id="the-components-of-gdp">5.2.1 The Components of GDP</h3>
<p>Economists divide GDP into four broad categories, each corresponding to different types of purchases represented in GDP:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Consumption expenditures: purchases by consumers</li>
<li>Private investment expenditures: purchases by firms</li>
<li>Government purchases: purchases by federal, state, and local governments</li>
<li>Net exports: net purchases by the foreign sector (domestic exports minus domestic imports)</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="consumption-expenditures">Consumption Expenditures</h4>
<p><a name="consumption-expenditures-term"><strong>Consumption expenditures</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchases of newly produced goods and services by households.</li>
<li>These purchases include flat-screen TVs, smartphones, automobiles, clothing, hairstyling services, jewelry, movie or basketball tickets, food, and all other consumer items.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can break down consumption into durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. <em>Durable goods</em>, such as automobiles or refrigerators, last for a long time. <em>Nondurable goods</em>, such as food, last for a short time. <em>Services</em> are work in which people play a prominent role in delivery (such as a dentist filling a cavity). They range from manicures to health care and are the fastest-growing component of consumption in the United States. Overall, consumption spending is the most important component of GDP, constituting about 69 percent of total purchases.</p>
<h4 id="private-investment-expenditures">Private Investment Expenditures</h4>
<p><a name="private-investment-expenditures-term"><strong>Private investment expenditures</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchases of newly produced goods and services by firms</li>
</ul>
<p>Consist of three components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, there is spending on new plants and equipment during the year. If a firm builds a new factory or purchases a new machine, the new factory or new machine is included in the year’s GDP. Purchasing an existing building or buying a used machine does not count in GDP, because the goods were not produced during the current year.</li>
<li>Second, newly produced housing is included in investment spending. The sale of an existing home to a new owner is not counted because the house was not built in the current year.</li>
<li>Finally, if firms add to their stock of inventories, the increase in inventories during the current year is included in GDP. If a hardware store had $1,000 worth of nuts and bolts on its shelves at the beginning of the year and $1,100 at the year’s end, its inventory investment is $100 $($1,000 - $,1000)$. This $100 increase in inventory investment is included in GDP.</li>
</ol>
<p>We call the total of new investment expenditures <strong>gross investment</strong>. During the year, some of the existing plant, equipment, and housing will deteriorate or wear out. This wear and tear is called <strong>depreciation</strong>, or sometimes a capital consumption allowance. If we subtract depreciation from gross investment, we obtain <strong>net investment</strong>.</p>
<p><a name="gross-investment-term"><strong>Gross investment</strong></a> - Total new investment expenditures.<br> <a name="depreciation-term"><strong>Depreciation</strong></a> - Reduction in the value of capital goods over a 1-year period due to physical wear and tear and to obsolescence; also called <em>capital consumption allowance</em>.<br> <a name="net-investment-term"><strong>Net investment</strong></a> - Gross investment minus depreciation.<br></p>
<h4 id="government-purchases">Government Purchases</h4>
<p><a name="government-purchases-term"><strong>Government purchases</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchases of newly produced goods and services by local, state, and federal governments.</li>
<li>This category does not include all spending by governments. It excludes <strong>transfer payments</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="transfer-payments-term"><strong>Transfer payments</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Payments from governments to individuals that do not correspond to the production of goods and services.</li>
<li>For example, payments for Social Security, welfare, and interest on government debt are all considered transfer payments and thus are not included in government purchases in GDP. Nothing is being produced by the recipients in return for money being paid, or “transferred,” to them. But wage payments to the police, postal workers, and the staff of the Internal Revenue Service are all included because they do correspond to services these workers are currently producing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because transfer payments are excluded from GDP, a vast portion of the budget of the federal government is not part of GDP.</p>
<h4 id="net-exports">Net Exports</h4>
<p>To understand the role of the foreign sector, we first need to define three terms. <strong>Imports</strong> are goods and services we buy from other countries. <strong>Exports</strong> are goods and services made here and sold to other countries. <strong>Net exports</strong> are total exports minus total imports.</p>
<p><a name="imports-term"><strong>Imports</strong></a> - A good or service produced in a foreign country and purchased by residents of the home countery (e.g., the United States).<br> <a name="export-term"><strong>Export</strong></a> - A good or service produced in the home counter (e.g., the United States) and sold in another country.<br> <a name="net-exports-term"><strong>Net exports</strong></a> - Exports minus imports.<br></p>
<p>Consumption, investment, and government purchases include all purchases by consumers, firms, and the government, whether or not the goods were produced in the United States. However, <strong>GDP is supposed to measure the goods produced in the United States. Consequently, we subtract purchases of foreign goods by consumers, firms, or the government when we calculate GDP because these goods were not produced in the United States. At the same time, we add to GDP any goods produced here and sold abroad</strong>, for example, airplanes made in the United States and sold in Europe. By including net exports as a component of GDP, we correctly measure U.S. production by adding exports and subtracting imports.</p>
<p>When we buy more goods from abroad than we sell, we have a <strong>trade deficit</strong>. A trade surplus occurs when our exports exceed our imports. Figure 5.3 shows the U.S. <strong>trade surplus</strong> as a share of GDP from 1960 to 2017. Although at times the United States has had a small trade surplus, it has generally run a trade deficit. In recent years, the trade deficit has increased and has fluctuated between 2 and 6 percent of GDP.</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together-the-gdp-equation">5.2.2 Putting It All Together: The GDP Equation</h3>
<p>We can summarize our discussion of who purchases GDP with a simple equation that combines the four components of GDP:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y = C + I + G + NX
\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<h2 id="the-income-approach-measuring-a-nations-macroeconomic-activity-using-national-income">5.3 The Income Approach: Measuring a Nation’s Macroeconomic Activity Using National Income</h2>
<p>Recall from the circular flow that one person’s production ends up being another person’s income. Income is the flip side of our macroeconomic coin. As a result, in addition to measuring a nation’s activity by measuring production, we can also gauge it by measuring a nation’s income. The total income earned by U.S. residents working in the United States and abroad is called <strong>national income</strong>.</p>
<p><a name="national-income-term"><strong>National income</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The total income earned by a nation’s residents both domestically and abroad in the production of goods and services.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="measuring-national-income">5.3.1 Measuring National Income</h3>
<p><a name="gross-national-product-term"><strong>Gross national product (GNP)</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>GDP plus net income earned abroad.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to national income, which measures the income earned in a given year by the entire private sector, we are sometimes interested in determining the total payments that flow directly into households, a concept known as <strong>personal income</strong>. To calculate personal income, we begin with national income and subtract any corporate profits that are retained by the corporation and not paid out as dividends to households. We also subtract all taxes on production and imports and social insurance taxes, which are payments for Social Security and Medicare. We then add any personal interest income received from the government and consumers and all transfer payments. The result is the total income available to households, or personal income. The amount of personal income that households retain after paying income taxes is called <strong>personal disposable income</strong>.</p>
<p><a name="personal-income-term"><strong>Personal income</strong></a> - Income, including transfer payments, received by households.<br> <a
name="personal-disposable-income-term"><strong>Personal disposable income</strong></a> - Personal income that households retain after paying income taxes.<br></p>
<h3 id="measuring-national-income-through-value-added">5.3.2 Measuring National Income through Value Added</h3>
<p>Another way to measure national income is to look at the <strong>value added</strong> of each firm in the economy. For a firm, we can measure its value added by the dollar value of the firm’s sales minus the dollar value of the goods and services purchased from other firms. What remains is the sum of all the income–wages, profits, rents, and interest–that the firm generates. By adding up the value added for all the firms in the economy (plus nonprofit and governmental organizations), we can calculate national income. Let’s consider a simple example illustrated in Table 5.3.</p>

<h3 id="measuring-real-versus-nominal-gdp">5.4.1 Measuring Real versus Nominal GDP</h3>
<p>Now we take a closer look at how real GDP is measured in modern economies. Let’s start with a simple economy in which there are only two goods–cars and computers–produced in the years 2011 and 2012. The data for this economy–the prices and quantities produced for each year–are shown in Table 5.4. The production of cars and the production of computers increased, but the production of computers increased more rapidly. The price of cars rose, while the price of computers remained the same.</p>
<blockquote>

</center>
<p>Let’s first calculate nominal GDP for this economy in each year. Nominal GDP is the total market value of goods and services produced in each year. Using the data in the table, we can see that nominal GDP for the year 2011 is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(4 \text{ cars } \times \$10,000) + (1 \text{ computers } \times \$5,000) = \$45,000
\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, nominal GDP for the year 2012 is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(5 \text{ cars } \times \$12,000) + (3 \text{ computers } \times \$5,000) = \$75,000
\]</span></p>
<p>Now we find real GDP. To compute real GDP, we calculate GDP using constant prices. What prices should we use? For the moment, let’s use the prices for the year 2011. Because we are using 2011 prices, real GDP and nominal GDP for 2011 are both equal to $45,000. But for 2012, they are different. In 2012, real GDP is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(5 \text{ cars } \times \$10,000) +(3 \text{ computers } \times \$5,000) =
\$65,000
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that real GDP for 2012, which is $65,000, is less than nominal GDP for 2012, which is $75,000. The reason real GDP is less than nominal GDP here is that prices of cars rose by $2,000 between 2011 and 2012, and we are measuring GDP using 2011 prices. We can measure real GDP for any other year simply by calculating GDP using constant prices.</p>
<p>We now calculate the growth in real GDP for this economy between 2011 and 2012. Because real GDP was $45,000 in 2011 and $65,000 in 2012, real GDP grew by $20,000. In percentage terms, this is a $20,000 increase from the initial level of $45,000 or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ Percentage growth in real GDP } = \frac{\$20,000}{\$45,000} = .444
\]</span></p>
<p>which equals 44.4 percent. This percentage is an average of the growth rates for both goods–cars and computers.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-the-gdp-deflator">5.4.2 How to Use the GDP Deflator</h3>
<p><a name="gdp-deflator-term"><strong>GDP deflator</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>An index that measures how the prices of goods and services included in GDP change over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ GDP Deflator } = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}} \times 100
\]</span></p>
<p>Using this formula, we find that the value of the GDP deflator for 2012 is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\$75,000}{\$65,000} \times 100 = 1.15 \times 100 = 115
\]</span></p>
<p>Because the value of the GDP deflator is 115 in 2012 and was 100 in the base year of 2011, this means prices rose by 15 percent between the two years:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{115 - 100}{100} = \frac{15}{100} = 0.15
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that this 15 percent is a weighted average of the price changes for the two goods–cars and computers.</p>
<p>Until 1996, the Commerce Department, which produces the GDP figures, used these formulas to calculate real GDP and measure changes in prices. Economists at the department chose a base year and measured real GDP by using the prices in that base year. They also calculated the GDP deflator, just as we did, by taking the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP. Today, the Commerce Department calculates real GDP and the price index for real GDP using a more complicated method. In our example, we measured real GDP using 2011 prices. But we could have also measured real GDP using prices from 2012. If we did, we would have come up with slightly different numbers both for the increase in prices between the two years and for the increase in real GDP. To avoid this problem, the Commerce Department now uses a <strong>chain-weighted index</strong>, which is a method for calculating price changes that takes an average of price changes using base years from consecutive years (i.e., 2011 and 2012 in our example). If you look online or at the data produced by the Commerce Department, you will see real GDP measured in chained dollars and a chain-type price index for GDP.</p>

<h2 id="fluctuations-in-gdp">5.5 Fluctuations in GDP</h2>
<p>As we have discussed, real GDP does not always grow smoothly–sometimes it collapses suddenly, and the result is an economic downturn. We call such fluctuations business cycles. Let’s look at an example of a business cycle from the late 1980s and early 1990s. Figure 5.6 plots real GDP for the United States from 2007 to 2009. Notice that in mid-1990, real GDP begins to fall. A recession is a period when real GDP falls for 6 or more consecutive months. Economists talk more in terms of quarters of the year–consecutive 3-month periods–than in terms of months. So, they would say that a recession occurs when real GDP falls for two consecutive quarters. The date at which the recession starts–that is, when output starts to decline–is called the peak. The date at which it ends–that is, when output starts to increase again–is called the trough. In Figure 5.6, we see the peak and trough of the recession. After a trough, the economy enters a recovery period, or period of expansion.</p>

<h3 id="shortcomings-of-gdp-as-a-measure-of-welfare">5.6.1 Shortcomings of GDP as a Measure of Welfare</h3>
<p>There are several recognized flaws in the construction of GDP. We should thus be cautious in interpreting GDP as a measure of our economic well-being because it does not take into account housework and childcare, leisure, the underground economy, or pollution.</p>
<h4 id="housework-and-childcare">Housework And Childcare</h4>
<p>First, GDP ignores transactions that do not take place in organized markets. The most important example is services–such as cleaning, cooking, and providing free childcare–that people do for themselves in their own homes. Because these services are not transferred through markets, GDP statisticians cannot measure them. If we included household production in GDP, measured GDP would be considerably higher than currently reported.</p>
<h4 id="leisure">Leisure</h4>
<p>Second, leisure time is not included in GDP because GDP is designed to be a measure of the production that occurs in the economy. To the extent that households value leisure, increases in leisure time will lead to higher social welfare, but not to higher GDP.</p>
<h4 id="underground-economy">Underground Economy</h4>
<p>Third, GDP ignores the underground economy, where transactions are not reported to official authorities. These transactions can be legal, but people don’t report the income they have generated because they want to avoid paying taxes on it. For example, wait staff may not report all their tips and owners of flea markets may make under-the-table cash transactions with their customers. Illegal transactions, such as profits from the illegal drug trade, also result in unreported income. In the United States in 2005, the Internal Revenue Service estimated (based on tax returns from 2001) that about $310 billion in federal income taxes from the underground economy was not collected each year. If the federal income tax rate that applies to income evaded from taxes was about 20 percent, approximately $1.5 trillion ($310/0.20) in income from the underground economy escaped the GDP accountants that year, or about 15 percent of GDP at the time.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we learned how economists and government statisticians measure the income and production for an entire country and what these measures are used for. Developing meaningful statistics for an entire economy is difficult. As we have seen, statistics can convey useful information–if they are used with care. Here are some of the main points to remember in this chapter:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The circular flow diagram shows how the production of goods and services generates income for households and how households purchase goods and services by firms. The expanded circular flow diagram includes government and the foreign sector.</li>
<li><em>Gross domestic product</em> (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a given year.</li>
<li>GDP consists of four components: consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports. The following equation combines these components:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>The GDP deflator is an index that measures how the prices of goods and services included in GDP change over time. The following equation helps us find the GDP deflator:</p>
