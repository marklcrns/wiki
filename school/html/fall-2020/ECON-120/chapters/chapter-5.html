<h2 id="the-flip-sides-of-macroeconomic-activity-production-and-income">5.1 The Flip Sides of Macroeconomic Activity: Production and Income</h2>
<p>Before we can study growth and fluctuations, we need to have a basic vocabulary and understanding of some key concepts. We begin with the terms production and income because these are the flip sides of the macroeconomic coin, so to speak. Every day, men and women go off to work, where they produce or sell merchandise or provide services. At the end of the week or month, they return home with their paychecks or income. They spend some of that money on other products and services, which are produced by other people. <strong>In other words, production leads to income, and income leads to production</strong>.</p>
<p>From a big picture perspective, we look at certain measures that will tell us how much the economy is producing and how well it is growing. We will also be able to measure the total income generated in the economy and how this income flows back to workers and investors. These two measures–a country’s production and income–are critical to a nation’s economic health. Macroeconomists collect and analyze production and income data to understand how many people will find jobs and whether their living standards are rising or falling. Government officials use the data and analysis to develop economic policies.</p>
<h3 id="the-circular-flow-of-production-and-income">The Circular Flow of Production and Income</h3>
<p>Let’s begin with a simple diagram known as the <em>circular flow</em>, shown in Figure 5.1. We start with a very simple economy that does not have a government or a foreign sector. Households and firms make transactions in two markets known as <em>factor markets</em> and <em>product markets</em>. In factor, or input, markets, households supply labor to firms. Households are also the ultimate owners of firms, as well as of all the resources firms use in their production, which we call <em>capital</em>. Consequently, we can think of households as providing capital to firms–land, buildings, and equipment–to produce output. Product, or output, markets are markets in which firms sell goods and services to consumers.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-5/figure-5.1.png" alt="Figure 5.1 The Circulatr Flow of Production and Income" /><figcaption>Figure 5.1 The Circulatr Flow of Production and Income</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The point of the circular flow diagram is simple and fundamental: Production generates income. In factor markets, when households supply labor and capital to firms, they are compensated by the firms. They earn wages for their work, and they earn interest, dividends, and rents on the capital they supply to the firms. The households then use their income to purchase goods and services in the product markets. The firm uses the revenues it receives from the sale of its products to pay for the factors of production (land, labor, and capital).</p>
<h2 id="the-production-approach-measuring-a-nations-macroeconomic-activity-using-gross-domestic-product">5.2 The Production Approach: Measuring a Nation’s Macroeconomic Activity Using Gross Domestic Product</h2>
<p><a name="gross-domestic-product-term"><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The total market value of final goods and services produced within an economy in a given year.</li>
<li>GDP is also the most common measure of an economy’s total output.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the owrds in the GDP definition are important, so let’s analyze them</p>
<p><em>Total market</em> value means we take the quantity of goods produced, multiply them by their respective prices, and then add up the totals. If an economy produced two cars at $25,000 per car and three computers at $2,000 per computer, the total value of these goods will be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
2 \text{ cars } \times \$25,000 \text{ per car }          &amp; = \$50,000 \\
3 \text{ computers } \times \$2,000 \text{ per computer } &amp; = \$\:\:6,000 \\
                                                          &amp; = \$56,000
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Final goods and services in the GDP definition means those goods and services that are sold to ultimate, or final, purchasers. For example, the two cars that were produced would be final goods if they were sold to households or to a business. However, to produce the cars the automobile manufacturer bought steel that went into the body of the cars, and we do not count this steel as a final good or service in GDP. Steel is an example of an intermediate good, one that is used in the production process. An <strong>intermediate good</strong> is not considered a final good or service.</p>
<p><a name="intermediate-good-term"><strong>Intermediate good</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Goods used in the production process that are not final goods and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason we do not count intermediate goods as final goods is to avoid double-counting. The price of the car already reflects the price of the steel contained in it. We do not want to count the steel twice.</p>
<p>The final words in our GDP definition are in <em>a given year</em>. GDP is expressed as a rate of production–that is, as “X” amount of dollars per year. In 2014, for example, GDP in the United States was $17,420 billion. Goods produced in prior years, such as cars or houses, are not included in GDP for a given year, even if one consumer sells a house or car to another in that year. Only newly produced products are included in GDP.</p>
<p>Because we measure GDP using the current prices for goods and services, GDP will increase if prices increase, even if the physical amount of goods that are produced remains the same. Suppose that next year the economy again produces two cars and three computers, but all the prices in the economy double: The price of cars is $50,000, and the price of computers is $4,000. GDP will also be twice as high, or $112,000, even though the quantity produced is the same as during the prior year:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
2 \text{ cars } \times \$50,000 \text{ per car } &amp;= \$100,000  \\
+ \\
3 \text{ computers } \times \$4,000 \text{ per computer } &amp;= \$\:\:12,000  \\
 &amp;= \$112,000
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>But to say that GDP has doubled would be misleading because exactly the same goods were produced. To avoid this problem, let’s apply the real-nominal principle, one of our five basic principles of economics.</p>
<p><a name="real-nominal-principle-term"><strong>Real-nominal principle</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>What matters to people is the real value of money or income–its purchasing power– not the face value of money or income.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we need is another measure of total output that doesn’t increase just because prices increase. For this reason, economists have developed the concept of <strong>real GDP</strong>, a measure that controls for changes in prices. Later in this chapter, we explain how real GDP is calculated. The basic idea is simple. When we use current prices to measure GDP, we are using <strong>nominal GDP</strong>. Nominal GDP can increase for one of two reasons: Either the production of goods and services has increased, or the prices of those goods and services have increased.</p>
<p><a name="real-gdp-term"><strong>Real GDP</strong></a> - A measure of GDP that controls for changes in price.<br> <a name="nominal-gdp-term"><strong>Nominal GDP</strong></a> - The value of GDP in current dollars.<br></p>
<p>To explain the concept of real GDP, we first need to look at a simple example. Suppose an economy produces a single good: computers. In year 1, 10 computers were produced, and each sold for $2,000. In year 2, 12 computers were produced, and each sold for $2,100. Nominal GDP is $20,000 in year 1 and $25,200 in year 2; it has increased by a factor of 1.26 or 26 percent. However, we can also measure real GDP by using year 1 prices as a measure of what was produced in year 1 and what was produced in year 2.</p>
<p>In year 1, real GDP is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
10 \text{ computers } \times \$2,000 \text{ per computer } = \$20,000
\]</span></p>
<p>In year 2, real GDP (in year 1 terms) is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
12 \text{ computers } \times \$2,000 \text{ per computer } = \$24,000
\]</span></p>
<p>Real GDP in year 2 is still greater than real GDP in year 1, now by a factor of 1.2, or 20 percent. The key idea is that we construct a measure using the same prices for both years and thereby take price changes into account.</p>
<p>Figure 5.2 plots real GDP for the U.S. economy for the years 1947 through 2013. The graph shows that real GDP has grown substantially over this period. This is what economists call <strong>economic growth</strong>–sustained increases in the real GDP of an economy over a long period of time.</p>

<h3 id="the-components-of-gdp">5.2.1 The Components of GDP</h3>
<p>Economists divide GDP into four broad categories, each corresponding to different types of purchases represented in GDP:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Consumption expenditures: purchases by consumers</li>
<li>Private investment expenditures: purchases by firms</li>
<li>Government purchases: purchases by federal, state, and local governments</li>
<li>Net exports: net purchases by the foreign sector (domestic exports minus domestic imports)</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="consumption-expenditures">Consumption Expenditures</h4>
<p><a name="consumption-expenditures-term"><strong>Consumption expenditures</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchases of newly produced goods and services by households.</li>
<li>These purchases include flat-screen TVs, smartphones, automobiles, clothing, hairstyling services, jewelry, movie or basketball tickets, food, and all other consumer items.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can break down consumption into durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. <em>Durable goods</em>, such as automobiles or refrigerators, last for a long time. <em>Nondurable goods</em>, such as food, last for a short time. <em>Services</em> are work in which people play a prominent role in delivery (such as a dentist filling a cavity). They range from manicures to health care and are the fastest-growing component of consumption in the United States. Overall, consumption spending is the most important component of GDP, constituting about 69 percent of total purchases.</p>
<h4 id="private-investment-expenditures">Private Investment Expenditures</h4>
<p><a name="private-investment-expenditures-term"><strong>Private investment expenditures</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchases of newly produced goods and services by firms</li>
</ul>
<p>Consist of three components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, there is spending on new plants and equipment during the year. If a firm builds a new factory or purchases a new machine, the new factory or new machine is included in the year’s GDP. Purchasing an existing building or buying a used machine does not count in GDP, because the goods were not produced during the current year.</li>
<li>Second, newly produced housing is included in investment spending. The sale of an existing home to a new owner is not counted because the house was not built in the current year.</li>
<li>Finally, if firms add to their stock of inventories, the increase in inventories during the current year is included in GDP. If a hardware store had $1,000 worth of nuts and bolts on its shelves at the beginning of the year and $1,100 at the year’s end, its inventory investment is $100 $($1,000 - $,1000)$. This $100 increase in inventory investment is included in GDP.</li>
</ol>
<p>We call the total of new investment expenditures <strong>gross investment</strong>. During the year, some of the existing plant, equipment, and housing will deteriorate or wear out. This wear and tear is called <strong>depreciation</strong>, or sometimes a capital consumption allowance. If we subtract depreciation from gross investment, we obtain <strong>net investment</strong>.</p>
<p><a name="gross-investment-term"><strong>Gross investment</strong></a> - Total new investment expenditures.<br> <a name="depreciation-term"><strong>Depreciation</strong></a> - Reduction in the value of capital goods over a 1-year period due to physical wear and tear and to obsolescence; also called <em>capital consumption allowance</em>.<br> <a name="net-investment-term"><strong>Net investment</strong></a> - Gross investment minus depreciation.<br></p>
<h4 id="government-purchases">Government Purchases</h4>
<p><a name="government-purchases-term"><strong>Government purchases</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchases of newly produced goods and services by local, state, and federal governments.</li>
<li>This category does not include all spending by governments. It excludes <strong>transfer payments</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="transfer-payments-term"><strong>Transfer payments</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Payments from governments to individuals that do not correspond to the production of goods and services.</li>
<li>For example, payments for Social Security, welfare, and interest on government debt are all considered transfer payments and thus are not included in government purchases in GDP. Nothing is being produced by the recipients in return for money being paid, or “transferred,” to them. But wage payments to the police, postal workers, and the staff of the Internal Revenue Service are all included because they do correspond to services these workers are currently producing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because transfer payments are excluded from GDP, a vast portion of the budget of the federal government is not part of GDP.</p>
<h4 id="net-exports">Net Exports</h4>
<p>To understand the role of the foreign sector, we first need to define three terms. <strong>Imports</strong> are goods and services we buy from other countries. <strong>Exports</strong> are goods and services made here and sold to other countries. <strong>Net exports</strong> are total exports minus total imports.</p>
<p><a name="imports-term"><strong>Imports</strong></a> - A good or service produced in a foreign country and purchased by residents of the home countery (e.g., the United States).<br> <a name="export-term"><strong>Export</strong></a> - A good or service produced in the home counter (e.g., the United States) and sold in another country.<br> <a name="net-exports-term"><strong>Net exports</strong></a> - Exports minus imports.<br></p>
<p>Consumption, investment, and government purchases include all purchases by consumers, firms, and the government, whether or not the goods were produced in the United States. However, <strong>GDP is supposed to measure the goods produced in the United States. Consequently, we subtract purchases of foreign goods by consumers, firms, or the government when we calculate GDP because these goods were not produced in the United States. At the same time, we add to GDP any goods produced here and sold abroad</strong>, for example, airplanes made in the United States and sold in Europe. By including net exports as a component of GDP, we correctly measure U.S. production by adding exports and subtracting imports.</p>
<p>When we buy more goods from abroad than we sell, we have a <strong>trade deficit</strong>. A trade surplus occurs when our exports exceed our imports. Figure 5.3 shows the U.S. <strong>trade surplus</strong> as a share of GDP from 1960 to 2017. Although at times the United States has had a small trade surplus, it has generally run a trade deficit. In recent years, the trade deficit has increased and has fluctuated between 2 and 6 percent of GDP.</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together-the-gdp-equation">5.2.2 Putting It All Together: The GDP Equation</h3>
<p>We can summarize our discussion of who purchases GDP with a simple equation that combines the four components of GDP:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y = C + I + G + NX
\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
Y  &amp;= \text{GDP} \\
C  &amp;= \text{Consumption} \\
I  &amp;= \text{Investment} \\
G  &amp;= \text{Government purchases} \\
NX &amp;= \text{Net exports}
\end{aligned}

<h2 id="the-income-approach-measuring-a-nations-macroeconomic-activity-using-national-income">5.3 The Income Approach: Measuring a Nation’s Macroeconomic Activity Using National Income</h2>
<p>Recall from the circular flow that one person’s production ends up being another person’s income. Income is the flip side of our macroeconomic coin. As a result, in addition to measuring a nation’s activity by measuring production, we can also gauge it by measuring a nation’s income. The total income earned by U.S. residents working in the United States and abroad is called <strong>national income</strong>.</p>
<p><a name="national-income-term"><strong>National income</strong></a></p>

<li>The total income earned by a nation’s residents both domestically and abroad in the production of goods and services.</li>
