<p>The <strong>money market</strong> is the market for money where the amount supplied and the amount demanded meet to determine the nominal interest rate. Recall that the nominal interest rate is the stated or quoted interest rate before adjusting for inflation. We begin by learning the factors that determine the public’s demand for money. Once we understand what affects the demand for money, we can see how the actions of the Federal Reserve determine the supply of money. Then, we see how the demand and supply of money together determine interest rates.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="the-demand-for-money">14.1 The Demand for Money</h2>
<p>Let’s think of money as simply one part of wealth. Suppose your total wealth is valued at $1,000. In what form will you hold your wealth? Should you put all your wealth into the stock market? Or perhaps into the bond market? Or should you hold some of your wealth in money–that is, currency and deposits in checking accounts?</p>
<h3 id="interest-rates-affect-money-demands">14.1.1 Interest Rates Affect Money Demands</h3>
<p>If you invest in assets such as stocks or bonds, you will generally earn income on them. <em>Stocks</em> are shares in the ownership of a corporation. There are two sources of income from stocks: dividends paid to their owners out of the profits of the corporation, and the typical increase in their value over time. <em>Bonds</em> are loans that are repaid with interest. Thus, both stocks and bonds provide returns to investors. If you hold your wealth in currency or in a checking account, however, you will receive either no interest or very low interest. And if inflation rises sharply, you might even lose money. Holding your wealth as money in currency or a checking account means you sacrifice some potential income.</p>
<p>Money does, however, provide a valuable service. It facilitates transactions. If you go to a grocery store to purchase cereal, the store will accept currency or a check, but you won’t be able to pay for cereal with your stocks and bonds. People hold money primarily for this basic reason: Money makes it easier to conduct everyday transactions. Economists call this reason for holding money the <strong>transaction demand for money</strong>. To understand the demand for money, we rely on the principle of opportunity cost.</p>
<p><a name="transaction-demand-for-money-term"><strong>Transaction demand for money</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The demand for money based on the desire to facilitate transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The opportunity cost of holding money is the return you could have earned by holding your wealth in other assets. We measure the opportunity cost of holding money by the interest rate. Suppose the interest rate available to you on a long-term bond is 6 percent per year. If you hold $100 of your wealth in the form of this bond, you’ll earn $6 a year. If you hold currency instead, you’ll earn no interest. So, the opportunity cost of holding $100 in currency is $6 per year, or 6 percent per year.</p>
<p>As interest rates increase in the economy, the opportunity cost of holding money also increases. Economists have found that as the opportunity cost of holding money increases, the public demands less money. The quantity demanded of money will decrease with an increase in interest rates.</p>
<p>In Figure 14.1, we draw a demand for money curve, <span class="math inline">M^{d}</span>, as a function of the interest rate. At higher interest rates, individuals will want to hold less money than they will at lower interest rates because the opportunity cost of holding money is higher. As interest rates rise from <span class="math inline">r_{0}</span> to <span class="math inline">r_{1}</span>, the quantity of money demanded falls from <span class="math inline">M^{0}</span> to <span class="math inline">M^{1}</span>.</p>

<h3 id="other-components-of-money-demand">14.1.2 Other Components of Money Demand</h3>
<p>Traditionally, economists have identified other motives besides transactions for individuals or firms to hold money. If you hold your wealth in the form of property, such as a house or a boat, it is costly to sell it on short notice if you need to obtain funds. These forms of wealth are <strong>illiquid</strong>, meaning that they are not easily transferable into money. If you hold your wealth in currency or checking accounts, you do not have this problem. Economists recognize that people have a <strong>liquidity demand for money</strong>; they want to hold money to make transactions on quick notice.</p>
<p><a name="illiquid-term"><strong>Illiquid</strong></a> - Not easily transferable to money.<br> <a name="liquidity-demand-for-money-term"><strong>Liquidity demand for money</strong></a> - The demand for money that represents the needs and desires individuals and firms have to make transactions on short notice without incurring excessive costs.<br></p>
<p>During periods of economic volatility, investors might not want to hold stocks and bonds because their prices might fall. Instead, they might convert them into holdings that fall into the M2 category, such as savings accounts and money market funds. These investments earn lower interest rates on average, but are less risky than stocks and bonds, whose prices can fluctuate. This demand for safer assets is called the <strong>speculative demand for money</strong>. For example, after the stock market began to fall in 2000, individuals became very uncertain about the future and shifted their funds from the stock market to money market mutual funds. This shift of assets from stocks to money temporarily increased M2. When the market started to recover, some investors shifted funds back into the stock market.</p>

<h3 id="open-market-operations">14.2.1 Open Market Operations</h3>
<p>The Fed can increase or decrease the total amount of reserves in the banking system through <strong>open market operations</strong>, which are the purchase or sale of U.S. government securities by the Fed. There are two types of open market operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>open market purchases</strong>, the Fed buys government bonds from the private sector.</li>
<li>In <strong>open market sales</strong>, the Fed sells government bonds to the private sector.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="open-market-operations-term"><strong>Open market operations</strong></a> - The purchase or slae of U.S. government securities by the Fed.<br> <a name="open-market-purchases-term"><strong>Open market purchases</strong></a> - The Fed’s purchase of government bonds from the private sector.<br> <a name="open-market-sales-term"><strong>Open market sales</strong></a> - The Fed’s sale of government bonds to the private sector.<br></p>
<p>To understand how the Fed can increase the supply of money, let’s trace what happens after an open market purchase. Suppose the Federal Reserve purchases $1 million worth of government bonds currently owned by the private sector. The Fed writes a check for $1 million and presents it to the party who sold the bonds. The Federal Reserve now owns those bonds. The party who sold the bonds then deposits the $1 million in its bank.</p>
<p>Here is the key to how the supply of money increases when the Fed purchases government bonds: As we explained in the last chapter, each bank must keep an account with the Fed containing both its required and excess reserves. The check written against the Federal Reserve increases the bank’s total reserves, essentially giving it more money to loan out. In this case, the bank’s account balance increases by $1 million. If the reserve requirement is 10 percent, the bank must keep $100,000 in reserves, but it can now loan out $900,000 from its excess reserves. Basically, when the Fed buys bonds, the proceeds go out into the economy. Open market purchases of bonds therefore increase the money supply.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has powers that ordinary citizens and even banks do not have. The Fed can write checks against itself to purchase government bonds without having any explicit “funds” in its account for the purchase. Banks accept these checks because they count as part of their total reserves.</p>
<p>As you might expect, open market sales will, conversely, decrease the supply of money. Suppose the Federal Reserve sells $1 million worth of government bonds to a Wall Street firm. The firm will pay for the bonds with a check for $1 million drawn on its bank and give this check to the Federal Reserve. The bank must either hand over $1 million in cash or, more likely, reduce its total reserves with the Federal Reserve by $1 million. When the Fed sells bonds, it is basically taking the money exchanged for them out of the hands of the public. Open market sales therefore decrease the money freely available in the economy.</p>

<p>Open market operations are the most important way in which the Federal Reserve changes the supply of money. There are four other ways in which the Fed can change the supply of money, which we discuss next.</p>
<p>Traditionally, open market operations have been the most important way in which the Federal Reserve has changed the supply of money. After the financial crisis, the Fed started to pay interest on reserves and banks dramatically increased their holdings of excess reserves. In this setting, five other tools to increase the money supply and change interest rates can be very important.</p>
<h4 id="changing-reserve-requirements">Changing Reserve Requirements</h4>
<p>Another way the Fed can change the money supply is by changing the reserve requirements for banks. If the Fed wishes to increase the supply of money, it can reduce banks’ reserve requirements, so they have more money to loan out. This would expand the money supply. To decrease the supply of money, the Federal Reserve can raise reserve requirements.</p>
<p>Changing reserve requirements is a powerful tool, but the Federal Reserve doesn’t use it very often because it disrupts the banking system. Suppose a bank is required to hold exactly 10 percent of its deposits as reserves and has loaned the other 90 percent out. If the Federal Reserve suddenly increases its reserve requirement to 20 percent, the bank would be forced to call in or cancel many of its loans. Its customers would not like this! Today, the Fed doesn’t make sharp changes in reserve requirements. It did in the past, including during the Great Depression, because it mistakenly believed that the banks were holding too much in excess reserves. Banks, however, were holding additional reserves because they wanted to protect themselves from bank runs. As a result, after the increase in required reserves, banks increased their reserves even more, further reducing the supply of money to the economy.</p>
<h4 id="paying-interest-on-reserves">Paying Interest on Reserves</h4>
<p>Since 2008, the Fed has paid interest on required and excess reserves that banks hold. By paying interest on reserves, the Fed can affect the willingness of banks to hold reserves. Higher interest payments on reserves will lead banks to hold more reserves, thereby reducing the money supply. Conversely, lower interest payments will lead to fewer reserves and an increased money supply. This tool has now become the single most important one that the Fed uses to change interest rates.</p>
<h4 id="changing-the-discount-rate">Changing the Discount Rate</h4>
<p>A third way the Fed can change the money supply is by changing the <em>discount rate</em>. The <strong>discount rate</strong> is the interest rate at which banks can borrow directly from the Fed. Suppose a major customer asks for a large loan from a bank that has no excess reserves. Unless the bank can find an additional source of funds, it will not be able to make the loan. Banks are reluctant to turn away major customers. They first try to borrow reserves from other banks through the <strong>federal funds market</strong>, a market in which banks borrow and lend reserves to and from one another. If the rate–called the <strong>federal funds rate</strong>–seems too high to the bank, it could borrow directly from the Federal Reserve at the discount rate. By changing the discount rate, the Federal Reserve can influence the amount of borrowing by banks. If the Fed raises the discount rate, banks will be discouraged from borrowing reserves because it costs more. Lowering the discount rate will induce banks to borrow additional reserves.</p>
<p><a name="discount-rate-term"><strong>Discount rate</strong></a> - The interest rate at which banks can borrow from the Fed.<br> <a name="federal-funds-market-term"><strong>Federal funds market</strong></a> - The market in which banks borrow and lend reserves to and from one another.<br> <a name="federal-funds-rate-term"><strong>Federal funds rate</strong></a> - The interest rate on reserves that banks lend each other.<br></p>
<h2 id="how-interest-rates-are-determined-combining-the-demand-and-supply-of-money">14.3 How Interest Rates Are Determined: Combining the Demand and Supply of Money</h2>
<p>Combining the demand for money, determined by the public, with the supply of money, determined by the Fed, we can see how interest rates are determined in the short run in a demand-and-supply model of the money market.</p>
<p>Figure 14.3 depicts a model of the money market. The supply of money is determined by the Federal Reserve, and we assume for simplicity that it is independent of interest rates. We represent this independence by a vertical supply curve for money, <span class="math inline">M^{s}</span>. In the same graph, we draw the demand for money $M^{d}$. Market equilibrium occurs where the demand for money equals the supply of money, at an interest rate of <span class="math inline">r^{*}</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-14/figure-14.3.png" alt="Figure 14.3" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At this equilibrium interest rate <span class="math inline">r^{*}</span>, the quantity of money demanded by the private sector equals the quantity of money supplied by the Federal Reserve. What happens if the interest rate is higher than <span class="math inline">r^{*}</span>? At a higher interest rate, the quantity of money demanded will be less than the fixed quantity supplied, so there will be an excess supply of money. In other markets, excess supplies cause the price to fall. The same result happens here. The “price of money” in the market for money is the interest rate. If the interest rate were below <span class="math inline">r^{*}</span>, the demand for money would exceed the fixed supply: There would be an excess demand for money. As in other markets when there are excess demands, the price rises. Here, the price of money or the interest rate would rise until it reached <span class="math inline">r^{*}</span>. As you can see, money-market equilibrium follows the same logic as any other economic equilibrium.</p>
<p>we can use this simple model of the money market to understand the power of the Federal Reserve. Suppose the Federal Reserve increases the money supply through an open market purchase of bonds. In Panel A of Figure 14.4, an increase in the supply of money shifts the money supply curve to the right, leading to lower interest rates. A decrease in the money supply through the Fed’s open market sale of bonds, as depicted in Panel B of Figure 14.4, decreases the supply of money, shifting the money supply curve to the left and increasing interest rates.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-14/figure-14.4.png" alt="Figure 14.4" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.4</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can also think of the process from the perspective of banks. Recall our discussion of money creation through the banking system. After the Fed’s open market purchase of bonds, some of the money the Fed paid for the bonds gets deposited into banks. Banks will want to make loans to consumers and businesses with that money because holding it in their reserves with the Fed earns them no interest. To entice people to borrow, banks will lower the interest rates they charge on their loans. After an open market purchase of bonds by the Fed, interest rates will fall throughout the entire economy.</p>
<h3 id="interest-rates-and-bond-prices">14.3.1 Interest Rates and Bond Prices</h3>
<p>To see why, recall that bonds represent a promise to pay money in the future. If you own a bond, you are entitled to receive payments on it at a later time. But why do the prices of bonds move in the opposite direction of interest rates?</p>
<p>Because a bond payment occurs in the future, we need to use the concept of present value from Chapter 12 to determine the value of this payment today. The price of a bond is simply the present value of its future payments. Consider a bond that makes a payment one period in the future. The price of the bond–the present value of the payment–is equal to</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\text{ price of bonds } = \frac{\text{ promised payment }}{1 + \text{ interest rate }}
</span></p>
<p>That is, the price of a bond is the payment promised, divided by one plus the interest rate.</p>
<p>Suppose the promised payment next year is $106 and the interest rate is 6 percent per year. The price of the bond will be</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\text{ price of bonds } = \frac{\$106}{1.06} = \$100
</span></p>
<p>In this case, the bond would cost $100 if it were issued today. But what happens if interest rates in the economy change later? What if rates rise higher than 6 percent or fall lower than 6 percent? What will the bond you are holding be worth then, if you decided, for example, you needed the money and had to sell it to someone else? This is an important question because most of the bonds for sale on the market are not newly issued bonds–they are bonds that have already been issued with specific promised payments that people are buying and selling from one another.</p>
<p>Let’s consider two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose the promised payment is still $106, but the interest rate falls from 6 to 4 percent per year. Using the formula, the price of the bond will rise to $106/1.04, or $101.92–$1.92 more than it was with an interest rate of 6 percent. The price of the bond rose because, at the lower interest rate of 4 percent, a buyer will need more money–$101.92 versus $100–to get the same $106 the bond will pay next year. In other words, at a lower interest rate the value today of a future payment (its present value) is higher.</li>
<li>Now suppose interest rates rise from 6 to 8 percent per year. In this case, the price you could sell your bond for will fall to $106/1.08, or $98.15. The reason the price falls is that a buyer would need only $98.15 to get the $106 next year. As interest rates rose, the price of the bond fell. In other words, at a higher interest rate, the value today of a future payment (its present value) is lower.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-open-market-operations-directly-affect-bond-prices">How Open Market Operations Directly Affect Bond Prices</h4>
<p>There is another way to understand why when bond prices change in one direction, interest rates will change in the opposite direction. We know that when the Federal Reserve buys bonds in the open market, interest rates fall. But think about what the Federal Reserve is doing when it conducts the open market purchase. The Federal Reserve is buying bonds from the public. As the Fed buys bonds, it increases the demand for bonds and raises their price. This is another reason bond prices rise as interest rates fall.</p>
<p>Similarly, interest rates rise following an open market sale of bonds by the Fed. When the Fed conducts an open market sale, it is selling bonds, increasing the supply of bonds in the market. With an increase in the supply of bonds, the price of bonds will fall.</p>
<p>Because the Federal Reserve can change interest rates with open market purchases and sales and thereby affect the price of bonds, you can now see why Wall Street firms typically hire Fed watchers (often former officials of the Federal Reserve) to try to predict what the Fed will do. If a Wall Street firm correctly predicts the Fed will surprise the market and lower interest rates, the firm could buy millions of dollars of bonds for itself or its clients prior to the Fed’s announcement and make vast profits as the prices of the bonds inevitably rise.</p>
<h4 id="good-news-for-the-economy-is-bad-news-for-bond-prices">Good News for the Economy is Bad News for Bond Prices</h4>
<p>You may have heard on television or read in the newspaper that prices in the bond market often fall in the face of good economic news, such as an increase in real output. Are the markets perverse? Why is good news for the economy bad news for the bond market?</p>
<p>We can understand the behavior of the bond market by thinking about the demand for money. When real GDP increases, the demand for money will increase. As the demand for money increases, the money demand curve will shift to the right. From our model of the money market, we know that increased money demand will increase interest rates. Bond prices move in the opposite direction from interest rates. Therefore, good news for the economy is bad news for the bond market.</p>
<h2 id="interest-rates-and-how-they-change-investment-and-output-gdp">14.4 Interest Rates and How They Change Investment and Output (GDP)</h2>
<p>Higher or lower interest rates are just a means to an end, though, for the Fed. The Fed’s ultimate goal is to change output–either to slow or speed the economy by influencing aggregate demand.</p>
<p>To show how the Fed affects the interest rate, which in turn affects investment (a component of GDP), and finally GDP itself, we combine our demand and supply for money with the curve that shows how investment spending is related to interest rates. This appears in Figure 14.5. Panel A in Figure 14.5 shows how interest rates are determined by the demand and supply for money. It is identical to Figure 14.3, which we studied earlier. The graph shows us the equilibrium interest rate for money. Now let’s move to Panel B in Figure 14.5. We can see that at the equilibrium interest rate <span class="math inline">r^{*}</span> the level of investment in the economy will be given by <span class="math inline">I^{*}</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-14/figure-14.5.png" alt="Figure 14.5" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.5</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We should note that consumption as well as investment can depend on interest rates. That is, spending on consumer durables, such as automobiles and refrigerators, will also depend negatively on the rate of interest. Consumer durables are really investment goods for the household: If you buy an automobile, you incur the cost today and receive benefits, such as the ability to use the car, in the future. As interest rates rise, the opportunity costs of investing in an automobile will rise. Consumers will respond to the increase in opportunity cost by purchasing fewer cars. In this chapter, we discuss how changes in interest rates affect investment, but keep in mind that the purchases of consumer durables are affected, too.</p>
<p>The equilibrium interest rate <span class="math inline">r^{*}</span> is determined in the money market. At that interest rate, investment spending is given by <span class="math inline">I^{*}</span>.</p>
<p>In Figure 14.6, we show the effects of an increase in the money supply using our money market and investment graphs. As the supply of money increases, interest rates fall from <span class="math inline">r_{0}</span> to <span class="math inline">r_{1}</span>. With lower interest rates, investment spending will increase from <span class="math inline">I_{0}</span> to <span class="math inline">I_{1}</span>. This increase in investment spending will then increase aggregate demand–the total demand for goods and services in the economy–and shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>We show the shift of the aggregate demand curve in Figure 14.7. With the increase in aggregate demand, both output (y) and the price level (P) in the economy as a whole will increase in the short run. Thus, by reducing interest rates, the Fed affects output and prices in the economy.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In summary, when the Fed increases the money supply, it leads to lower interest rates and increased investment spending. In turn, a higher level of investment spending will ultimately lead to a higher level of GDP.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{array}{lllllllll}

</span></p>
<p>The Fed can also use its influence to increase interest rates, which will have the exact opposite effect. Investment spending will fall, along with aggregate demand. The aggregate demand curve will shift to the left, and the price level and output in the economy will fall, too. We can again represent this entire sequence of events:</p>
<p><span class="math display">

<h3 id="monetary-policy-and-international-trade">14.4.1 Monetary Policy and International Trade</h3>
<p>Suppose the Federal Reserve lowers U.S. interest rates through an open market purchase of bonds. As a result, investors in the United States will be earning lower interest rates and will seek to invest some of their funds abroad. To invest abroad, they will need to sell their U.S. dollars and buy the foreign currency of the country where they intend to invest. This will affect the <strong>exchange rate</strong>–the rate at which one currency trades for another currency in the market. As more investors sell their dollars to buy foreign currency, the exchange rate will fall. A fall in the exchange rate or a decrease in the value of a currency is called <strong>depreciation of a currency</strong>. Lower U.S. interest rates brought on by the Fed will cause the dollar to depreciate. This will ultimately change the demand and supply of goods and services around the globe because it will make U.S. goods cheaper than foreign goods. Let’s see why.</p>
<p><a name="exchange-rate-term"><strong>Exchange rate</strong></a> - The price at which currencies trade for one another in the market.<br> <a name="depreciation-of-a-currency-term"><strong>Depreciation of a currency</strong></a> - A decrease in the value of a currency.<br></p>
<p>In this case, the lower value of the dollar will mean that U.S. goods become relatively cheaper on world markets. Suppose the exchange rate is two Swiss francs to the dollar, meaning you will receive two Swiss francs for every dollar you exchange. If a U.S. machine sells for $100,000, it will cost 200,000 Swiss francs. Now suppose the value of the dollar depreciates so that one dollar now buys only one Swiss franc. The same U.S. machine will now cost Swiss residents half of what they used to pay for it–just 100,000 francs instead of 200,000. In other words, the lower value of the dollar makes U.S. goods cheaper for foreigners. As a result, foreign residents will want to buy more U.S. goods, and U.S. companies will want to export more goods to meet the higher foreign demand.</p>
<p>That’s the good news about the lower value of the U.S. dollar. The bad news is that the lower value of the dollar will make it more expensive for U.S. residents to buy foreign goods. If the exchange rate were still two Swiss francs to the dollar as it originally was at the outset of our example, Swiss chemicals with a price tag of 60,000 francs would cost a U.S. resident $30,000. If the exchange rate of the dollar depreciates to one franc per dollar, however, the same chemicals will cost twice as much–$60,000. As the dollar depreciates, imports become more expensive, and U.S. residents tend to import fewer of them.</p>
<p>Let’s recap this: As the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar falls, U.S. goods become cheaper and foreign goods become more expensive. The United States then exports more goods and imports fewer goods. Net exports increase, in other words. This increase in net exports increases the demand for U.S. goods and increases GDP. Remember that this all began with an open market purchase of bonds by the Fed that increased the money supply. Here is the sequence of events:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{array}{lllllllllll}
  \text{open} &amp;  &amp; \text{decrease} &amp;  &amp; \text{fall in} &amp;  &amp; \text{fall in} &amp;  &amp; \text{increase in} &amp; &amp; \text{increase} \\
  \text{market} &amp; \to &amp; \text{in money} &amp; \to &amp; \text{interest} &amp; \to &amp; \text{exchange} &amp; \to &amp; \text{net} &amp; \to &amp; \text{in} \\
  \text{bond purchase} &amp;  &amp; \text{supply} &amp;  &amp; \text{rates} &amp;  &amp; \text{rate} &amp; &amp; \text{exports} &amp; &amp; \text{GDP} \\
\end{array}
</span></p>
<p>The three new links in the sequence are from interest rates to exchange rates, from exchange rates to net exports, and from net exports to GDP.</p>
<p>This sequence also works in reverse. If the Fed conducts an open market sale of bonds, U.S. interest rates rise. As a result, foreign investors earning lower interest rates elsewhere will want to move their money to the United States where they can earn a higher return. As they buy more U.S. dollars, the exchange rate for the dollar will increase, and the dollar will increase in value. An increase in the value of a currency is called <strong>appreciation of a currency</strong>. The appreciation of the dollar will make U.S. goods more expensive for foreigners and imports cheaper for U.S. residents. Suppose the U.S. dollar appreciates, and each dollar can now be exchanged for three Swiss francs instead of two. The same machine the Swiss had to pay 200,000 francs for when the exchange rate was one dollar to two francs now costs 300,000 francs. The Swiss chemicals U.S. residents bought for $30,000 will now cost them less–just $20,000.</p>
<p><a name="appreciation-of-a-currency-term"><strong>Appreciation of a currency</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in the value of a currency.</li>
</ul>
<p>When U.S. interest rates rise as a result of an open market sale by the Fed, we expect exports to decrease and imports to increase, decreasing net exports. The decrease in net exports will reduce the demand for U.S. goods and lead to a fall in output. Here is the sequence of events:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{array}{lllllllllll}
  \text{open} &amp;  &amp; \text{decrease} &amp;  &amp; \text{rise in} &amp;  &amp; \text{rise in} &amp;  &amp; \text{decrease in} &amp; &amp; \text{decrease} \\

\end{array}
</span></p>
<p>To summarize, an increase in interest rates will reduce both investment spending (including consumer durables) and net exports. A decrease in interest rates will increase investment spending and net exports. As you can see, monetary policy in an open economy is even more powerful than monetary policy used in a closed economy.</p>
<p>The Fed and other central banks are well aware of the power they have to influence exchange rates and international trade. Countries that depend extensively on international trade–such as Canada and Switzerland–find that the effects of monetary policy on exchange rates are critical to their economic well-being.</p>
<h2 id="monetary-policy-challenges-for-the-fed">14.5 Monetary Policy Challenges for the Fed</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen how changes in the money supply affect aggregate demand, we can see that the government has two different types of tools to change the level of GDP in the short run: The government can use either fiscal policy–changes in the level of taxes or government spending–or monetary policy–changes in the supply of money and interest rates–to alter the level of GDP.</p>
<p>If the current level of GDP is below full employment or potential output, the government can use expansionary policies such as tax cuts, increased spending, or increases in the money supply to raise the level of GDP and reduce unemployment. If the current level of GDP exceeds full employment or potential output, the economy will overheat, and the rate of inflation will increase. To avoid this overheating, the government can use contractionary policies to reduce the level of GDP back to full employment or potential output.</p>
<p>Earlier, we explored some of the limitations of stabilization policy. We saw that fiscal policy is subject to lags and fraught with complications because political parties have different ideas about what the government should or should not do, and it takes them time to reach agreement. Monetary policy also has its complications.</p>
<h3 id="lags-in-monetary-policy">14.5.1 Lags in Monetary Policy</h3>
<p>Recall that there are two types of lags in policy. <em>Inside lags</em> are the time it takes for policymakers to recognize and implement policy changes. <em>Outside lags</em> are the time it takes for policy to actually work.</p>
<p>The inside lags for monetary policy are relatively short compared to those for fiscal policy. The FOMC meets eight times a year and can decide on major policy changes at any time and very quickly. It can even give the chairperson of the Board of Governors some discretion to make changes between meetings.</p>
<p>Of course, it does take time for the people working at the Fed to recognize that problems are beginning to occur in the economy. A good example is the 1990 recession. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. After the invasion, there was some concern that higher oil prices and the uncertainty of the political situation in Kuwait would trigger a recession in the United States, which, of course, is heavily dependent on oil. However, Alan Greenspan, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress as late as October 1990 that the economy had not yet slipped into a recession. Not until December did Greenspan declare that the economy had entered into a recession. Yet, looking back, we now know the recession had actually started 5 months earlier, in July.</p>
<p>The outside lags related to monetary policy, however, are quite long. Most econometric models predict it will take at least 2 years for most of the effects of an interest rate cut to be felt. This delay means that for the Fed to conduct successful monetary policy, it must be able to accurately forecast 2 years in the future! However, the Fed has difficulty predicting when recessions are about to occur. As an example, in May 2000 the Fed–fearing a rise in inflation–raised the federal funds rate from 6.00 to 6.50 percent. Yet, on January 3, 2001, the Fed reversed itself and restored the rate to 6.00 percent because it feared a recession. It was too little–and too late–to prevent the 2001 recession. And the Fed also failed to predict our latest severe recession and did not believe the problems in the housing market would spill over to the financial sector.</p>
<p>Because of the lags for monetary policy and the difficulties of forecasting the economy, many economists believe the Fed should not take a very active role in trying to stabilize the economy. Instead, they recommend the Fed concentrate on keeping the inflation rate low and stable.</p>
<h3 id="influencing-market-expectations-from-the-federal-funds-rate-to-interest-rates-on-long-term-bonds">14.5.2 Influencing Market Expectations: From the Federal Funds Rate to Interest Rates on Long-Term Bonds</h3>
<p>It is important to recognize that through its traditional open market policies, the Fed directly controls only very short-term interest rates in the economy, not long-term interest rates. In fact, when the Fed makes its decisions on monetary policy, it really decides what the rate should be in the federal funds market–the market in which banks trade reserves overnight. Once the Fed decides what rate it wants in the market, it conducts open market operations–buying and selling short-term government bonds–to achieve this rate. Thus, when the Federal Reserve decides the course of monetary policy, it is really just setting a very short-term interest rate for the economy.</p>
<p>However, when a firm is deciding on a long-term investment or a household is deciding whether to purchase a new home, it will base its decisions on the interest rate at which it can borrow money, and this will typically be a long-term interest rate–not a short-term rate. For example, a household might take out a 30-year mortgage to purchase a home. If the rate is too high, it might not take out the loan. So, for the Fed to control investment spending, it must also somehow influence long-term rates. It can do this indirectly by influencing short-term rates. Here’s how.</p>
<p>Long-term interest rates can be thought of as averages of current and expected future short-term interest rates. To see why future short-term interest rates are important, consider putting $100 of your money in the bank for 2 years. If the interest rate is 5 percent for the first year, you would have $105 at the end of that year. If the interest rate for the following year were 10 percent, you would then have <span class="math inline">\$115.50(\$105 \times 1.10)</span></p>
<h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h2>
<p>This chapter showed how monetary policy affects aggregate demand and the economy in the short run. Together, the demand for money by the public and the supply of money determined by the Federal Reserve determine interest rates. Changes in interest rates will in turn affect investment and output. In the international economy, interest rates also affect exchange rates and net exports. Still, there are limits to what effective monetary policies can do. Here are the main points of the chapter:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The demand for money depends negatively on the interest rate and positively on the level of prices and real GDP.</li>
<li>The Fed can determine the supply of money through <em>open market purchases</em> and <em>sales</em>, changing reserve requirements, changing the discount rate, or increasing lending to banks and other institutions. Open market operations are the primary tool the Fed uses to implement monetary policy.</li>
<li>The level of interest rates is determined in the <em>money market</em> by the demand for money and the supply of money.</li>
<li>To increase the level of GDP, the Federal Reserve buys bonds on the open market. To decrease the level of GDP, the Federal Reserve sells bonds on the open market.</li>
<li>An increase in the money supply will decrease interest rates, increase investment spending, and increase output. A decrease in the money supply will increase interest rates, decrease investment spending, and decrease output.</li>
