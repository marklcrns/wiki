<p>The <strong>money market</strong> is the market for money where the amount supplied and the amount demanded meet to determine the nominal interest rate. Recall that the nominal interest rate is the stated or quoted interest rate before adjusting for inflation. We begin by learning the factors that determine the public’s demand for money. Once we understand what affects the demand for money, we can see how the actions of the Federal Reserve determine the supply of money. Then, we see how the demand and supply of money together determine interest rates.</p>
<p><a name="money-market-term"><strong>Money market</strong></a></p>

</ul>
<h2 id="the-demand-for-money">14.1 The Demand for Money</h2>
<p>Let’s think of money as simply one part of wealth. Suppose your total wealth is valued at $1,000. In what form will you hold your wealth? Should you put all your wealth into the stock market? Or perhaps into the bond market? Or should you hold some of your wealth in money–that is, currency and deposits in checking accounts?</p>
<h3 id="interest-rates-affect-money-demands">14.1.1 Interest Rates Affect Money Demands</h3>
<p>If you invest in assets such as stocks or bonds, you will generally earn income on them. <em>Stocks</em> are shares in the ownership of a corporation. There are two sources of income from stocks: dividends paid to their owners out of the profits of the corporation, and the typical increase in their value over time. <em>Bonds</em> are loans that are repaid with interest. Thus, both stocks and bonds provide returns to investors. If you hold your wealth in currency or in a checking account, however, you will receive either no interest or very low interest. And if inflation rises sharply, you might even lose money. Holding your wealth as money in currency or a checking account means you sacrifice some potential income.</p>
<p>Money does, however, provide a valuable service. It facilitates transactions. If you go to a grocery store to purchase cereal, the store will accept currency or a check, but you won’t be able to pay for cereal with your stocks and bonds. People hold money primarily for this basic reason: Money makes it easier to conduct everyday transactions. Economists call this reason for holding money the <strong>transaction demand for money</strong>. To understand the demand for money, we rely on the principle of opportunity cost.</p>
<p><a name="transaction-demand-for-money-term"><strong>Transaction demand for money</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The demand for money based on the desire to facilitate transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The opportunity cost of holding money is the return you could have earned by holding your wealth in other assets. We measure the opportunity cost of holding money by the interest rate. Suppose the interest rate available to you on a long-term bond is 6 percent per year. If you hold $100 of your wealth in the form of this bond, you’ll earn $6 a year. If you hold currency instead, you’ll earn no interest. So, the opportunity cost of holding $100 in currency is $6 per year, or 6 percent per year.</p>
<p>As interest rates increase in the economy, the opportunity cost of holding money also increases. Economists have found that as the opportunity cost of holding money increases, the public demands less money. The quantity demanded of money will decrease with an increase in interest rates.</p>
<p>In Figure 14.1, we draw a demand for money curve, <span class="math inline">\(M^{d}\)</span>, as a function of the interest rate. At higher interest rates, individuals will want to hold less money than they will at lower interest rates because the opportunity cost of holding money is higher. As interest rates rise from <span class="math inline">\(r_{0}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(r_{1}\)</span>, the quantity of money demanded falls from <span class="math inline">\(M^{0}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(M^{1}\)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="other-components-of-money-demand">14.1.2 Other Components of Money Demand</h3>
<p>Traditionally, economists have identified other motives besides transactions for individuals or firms to hold money. If you hold your wealth in the form of property, such as a house or a boat, it is costly to sell it on short notice if you need to obtain funds. These forms of wealth are <strong>illiquid</strong>, meaning that they are not easily transferable into money. If you hold your wealth in currency or checking accounts, you do not have this problem. Economists recognize that people have a <strong>liquidity demand for money</strong>; they want to hold money to make transactions on quick notice.</p>
<p><a name="illiquid-term"><strong>Illiquid</strong></a> - Not easily transferable to money.<br> <a name="liquidity-demand-for-money-term"><strong>Liquidity demand for money</strong></a> - The demand for money that represents the needs and desires individuals and firms have to make transactions on short notice without incurring excessive costs.<br></p>
<p>During periods of economic volatility, investors might not want to hold stocks and bonds because their prices might fall. Instead, they might convert them into holdings that fall into the M2 category, such as savings accounts and money market funds. These investments earn lower interest rates on average, but are less risky than stocks and bonds, whose prices can fluctuate. This demand for safer assets is called the <strong>speculative demand for money</strong>. For example, after the stock market began to fall in 2000, individuals became very uncertain about the future and shifted their funds from the stock market to money market mutual funds. This shift of assets from stocks to money temporarily increased M2. When the market started to recover, some investors shifted funds back into the stock market.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-federal-reserve-can-change-the-money-supply">14.2 How the Federal Reserve Can Change the Money Supply</h2>
<h3 id="open-market-operations">14.2.1 Open Market Operations</h3>
<p>The Fed can increase or decrease the total amount of reserves in the banking system through <strong>open market operations</strong>, which are the purchase or sale of U.S. government securities by the Fed. There are two types of open market operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>open market purchases</strong>, the Fed buys government bonds from the private sector.</li>
<li>In <strong>open market sales</strong>, the Fed sells government bonds to the private sector.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="open-market-operations-term"><strong>Open market operations</strong></a> - The purchase or slae of U.S. government securities by the Fed.<br> <a name="open-market-purchases-term"><strong>Open market purchases</strong></a> - The Fed’s purchase of government bonds from the private sector.<br> <a name="open-market-sales-term"><strong>Open market sales</strong></a> - The Fed’s sale of government bonds to the private sector.<br></p>
<p>To understand how the Fed can increase the supply of money, let’s trace what happens after an open market purchase. Suppose the Federal Reserve purchases $1 million worth of government bonds currently owned by the private sector. The Fed writes a check for $1 million and presents it to the party who sold the bonds. The Federal Reserve now owns those bonds. The party who sold the bonds then deposits the $1 million in its bank.</p>
<p>Here is the key to how the supply of money increases when the Fed purchases government bonds: As we explained in the last chapter, each bank must keep an account with the Fed containing both its required and excess reserves. The check written against the Federal Reserve increases the bank’s total reserves, essentially giving it more money to loan out. In this case, the bank’s account balance increases by $1 million. If the reserve requirement is 10 percent, the bank must keep $100,000 in reserves, but it can now loan out $900,000 from its excess reserves. Basically, when the Fed buys bonds, the proceeds go out into the economy. Open market purchases of bonds therefore increase the money supply.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has powers that ordinary citizens and even banks do not have. The Fed can write checks against itself to purchase government bonds without having any explicit “funds” in its account for the purchase. Banks accept these checks because they count as part of their total reserves.</p>
<p>As you might expect, open market sales will, conversely, decrease the supply of money. Suppose the Federal Reserve sells $1 million worth of government bonds to a Wall Street firm. The firm will pay for the bonds with a check for $1 million drawn on its bank and give this check to the Federal Reserve. The bank must either hand over $1 million in cash or, more likely, reduce its total reserves with the Federal Reserve by $1 million. When the Fed sells bonds, it is basically taking the money exchanged for them out of the hands of the public. Open market sales therefore decrease the money freely available in the economy.</p>
<h3 id="other-tools-of-the-fed">14.2.2 Other Tools of the Fed</h3>
<p>Open market operations are the most important way in which the Federal Reserve changes the supply of money. There are four other ways in which the Fed can change the supply of money, which we discuss next.</p>
<p>Traditionally, open market operations have been the most important way in which the Federal Reserve has changed the supply of money. After the financial crisis, the Fed started to pay interest on reserves and banks dramatically increased their holdings of excess reserves. In this setting, five other tools to increase the money supply and change interest rates can be very important.</p>
<h4 id="changing-reserve-requirements">Changing Reserve Requirements</h4>
<p>Another way the Fed can change the money supply is by changing the reserve requirements for banks. If the Fed wishes to increase the supply of money, it can reduce banks’ reserve requirements, so they have more money to loan out. This would expand the money supply. To decrease the supply of money, the Federal Reserve can raise reserve requirements.</p>
<p>Changing reserve requirements is a powerful tool, but the Federal Reserve doesn’t use it very often because it disrupts the banking system. Suppose a bank is required to hold exactly 10 percent of its deposits as reserves and has loaned the other 90 percent out. If the Federal Reserve suddenly increases its reserve requirement to 20 percent, the bank would be forced to call in or cancel many of its loans. Its customers would not like this! Today, the Fed doesn’t make sharp changes in reserve requirements. It did in the past, including during the Great Depression, because it mistakenly believed that the banks were holding too much in excess reserves. Banks, however, were holding additional reserves because they wanted to protect themselves from bank runs. As a result, after the increase in required reserves, banks increased their reserves even more, further reducing the supply of money to the economy.</p>
<h4 id="paying-interest-on-reserves">Paying Interest on Reserves</h4>
<p>Since 2008, the Fed has paid interest on required and excess reserves that banks hold. By paying interest on reserves, the Fed can affect the willingness of banks to hold reserves. Higher interest payments on reserves will lead banks to hold more reserves, thereby reducing the money supply. Conversely, lower interest payments will lead to fewer reserves and an increased money supply. This tool has now become the single most important one that the Fed uses to change interest rates.</p>
<h4 id="changing-the-discount-rate">Changing the Discount Rate</h4>
<p>A third way the Fed can change the money supply is by changing the <em>discount rate</em>. The <strong>discount rate</strong> is the interest rate at which banks can borrow directly from the Fed. Suppose a major customer asks for a large loan from a bank that has no excess reserves. Unless the bank can find an additional source of funds, it will not be able to make the loan. Banks are reluctant to turn away major customers. They first try to borrow reserves from other banks through the <strong>federal funds market</strong>, a market in which banks borrow and lend reserves to and from one another. If the rate–called the <strong>federal funds rate</strong>–seems too high to the bank, it could borrow directly from the Federal Reserve at the discount rate. By changing the discount rate, the Federal Reserve can influence the amount of borrowing by banks. If the Fed raises the discount rate, banks will be discouraged from borrowing reserves because it costs more. Lowering the discount rate will induce banks to borrow additional reserves.</p>

<p>Combining the demand for money, determined by the public, with the supply of money, determined by the Fed, we can see how interest rates are determined in the short run in a demand-and-supply model of the money market.</p>
<p>Figure 14.3 depicts a model of the money market. The supply of money is determined by the Federal Reserve, and we assume for simplicity that it is independent of interest rates. We represent this independence by a vertical supply curve for money, <span class="math inline">\(M^{s}\)</span>. In the same graph, we draw the demand for money $M^{d}$. Market equilibrium occurs where the demand for money equals the supply of money, at an interest rate of <span class="math inline">\(r^{*}\)</span>.</p>
