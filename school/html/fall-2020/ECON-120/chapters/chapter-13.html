<h1 id="chapter-13-money-and-the-banking-system">Chapter 13: Money and the Banking System</h1>
<p><strong>Normally we expect governments to prevent the wholesale failures of banks.</strong></p>
<p>But during the recent financial crisis, the country of Iceland took the opposite approach and let the major banks in the country simply collapse.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2003, the three major banks in Iceland changed their business model to become aggressive international banking institutions, attracting deposits from foreign countries and vastly expanding their portfolio of loans. The result was 5 years of incredible prosperity for the country and its bank. Unfortunately, when the world financial crisis hit in 2008, this financing model no longer was sustainable. Funds quickly disappeared from the banks and the government and the people of Iceland faced a stark choice: bail out the banks by using public funds or let the banks go bankrupt and let those who invested in the banks take losses.</p>
<p>Eventually, Iceland decided on the bankruptcy route, much to the dismay of investors abroad. Unlike Ireland, which faced a similar situation, the government and the people of Iceland were willing to let the banks fail. Although this caused a severe recession for Iceland, its economy actually recovered faster than many of the countries, including Ireland that bailed out its banks. By 2014, its GDP exceeded the pre-crisis level. Some do wonder, however, whether an increased tourist boom was partly responsible for the recovery.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-money">13.1 What is Money?</h2>
<p>Economists define <strong>money</strong> as any items that are regularly used in economic transactions or exchanges and accepted by buyers and sellers. Let’s consider some examples of money used in that way.</p>
<p><a name="money-term"><strong>Money</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Any items that are regularly used in economic transactions or exchanges and accepted by buyers and sellers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="three-properties-of-money">13.1.1 Three Properties of Money</h3>
<h4 id="money-serves-as-a-medium-of-exchange">Money Serves as a Medium of Exchange</h4>
<p>As our examples illustrate, money is given by buyers to sellers in economic exchanges; therefore, it serves as a <strong>medium of exchange</strong>. Suppose you had a car you wanted to sell in order to buy a boat and money did not exist. You could look for a person who had a boat and wanted to buy a car and then trade your car directly for a boat. This is an example of <strong>barter</strong>: the exchange of one good or service for another.</p>
<p><a name="medium-of-exchange-term"><strong>Medium of exchange</strong></a> - Any item that buyers give to sellers when they purchase goods and services<br> <a name="barter-term"><strong>Barter</strong></a> - The exchange of one good or service for another<br></p>
<p>But there are obvious problems with barter. Suppose local boat owners were interested in selling boats but not interested in buying your car. Unless there were a <strong>double coincidence of wants</strong>–that is, unless you wanted to trade a car for a boat, and the boat owner wanted to trade a boat for your car–this economic exchange wouldn’t occur. The probability of a double coincidence of wants occurring is very, very tiny. Even if a boat owner wanted a car, he or she might want a different type of car than yours.</p>
<p><a name="double-coincidence-of-wants-term"><strong>Double coincidence of wants</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The problem in a system of barter that one person may not have the other desires.</li>
</ul>
<p>By serving as a medium of exchange, money solves this bartering problem. The car owner can sell the car to anyone who wants it and receive money in return. With that money, the car owner can then find someone who owns a boat and purchase the boat for money. The boat owner can use the money in any way he or she pleases. With money, there is no need for a double coincidence of wants. This is why money exists in all societies: It makes economic transactions much easier.</p>
<p>Here is another way to think about this. One of our key principles of economics is that individuals are better off through voluntary exchange.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../spring-2020/ECON-121/notes/ch-2.html#the-principle-of-voluntary-exchange">📑 The Principle of Voluntary Exchange</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Money allows individuals to actually <em>make</em> these exchanges. Without money, we would be left with a barter system, and most transactions that make both people better off would not be possible.</p>
<h4 id="money-serves-as-a-unit-of-account">Money Serves as a Unit of Account</h4>
<p>Money also provides a convenient measuring rod when prices for all goods are quoted in money terms. A boat may be listed for sale at $5,000 in money terms, a car at $10,000, and a movie ticket at $5. We could, in principle, quote everything in terms of movie tickets. The boat would be worth 1,000 tickets, and the car would be worth 2,000 tickets. But because we are using money and not movie tickets as a medium of exchange, it is much easier to express all prices in terms of money. A <strong>unit of account</strong> is a standard unit in which we can state prices and compare the value of goods and services. In our economy, money is the unit of account because we quote all prices in terms of money. It is convenient to use the medium of exchange as the unit of account, so we can quote prices for all goods and services in terms of the same units we use in transactions–in our case, money.</p>
<p><a name="unit-of-account-term"><strong>Unit of account</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>A standart unit in which prices can be stated and the value of goods and services can be compared.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="money-serves-as-a-store-of-value">Money Serves as a Store of Value</h4>
<p>If you sell your car to purchase a boat, you may not be able to purchase the boat immediately. In the meantime, you will be holding the money you received from the sale. Ideally, during that period, the value of the money will not fall. What we are referring to here is the function of money as a <strong>store of value</strong>.</p>
<p><a name="store-of-value-term"><strong>Store of value</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The proerty of money that holds that money preserves value until it is used in an exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>Money is actually a somewhat imperfect store of value because of inflation. Suppose inflation is 10 percent a year, which means average prices rise 10 percent each year. Let’s say you sold a tennis racket for $100 in order to buy 10 CDs worth $100, but you waited a year to buy them. Unfortunately, because of inflation, at the end of the year the 10 CDs cost $110 $($100×1.10)$, or $11 each. With your $100, you can now buy only 9 CDs and get $1 in change. Your money has lost some of its stored value.</p>
<p>As long as inflation is low and you do not hold the money for a long time, the loss in its purchasing power won’t be a big problem. But as inflation rates increase, money becomes less useful as a store of value.</p>
<h4 id="different-types-of-monetary-systems">Different Types of Monetary Systems</h4>
<p>Through history, the world has witnessed different types of monetary systems. In one system a commodity serves as money, such as gold or silver in bars or coins. This is an example of <strong>commodity money</strong>. At some point, governments began issuing paper money. However, the paper money was backed by an underlying commodity, for example, so many ounces of gold per unit of paper currency. Under a traditional <strong>gold standard</strong>, an individual could present paper money to the government and receive its stated value in gold. In other words, paper money could be exchanged for gold. Until 1933 in the United States, individuals could exchange their dollars for gold. However, President Franklin Roosevelt banned private possession of gold in 1933, although foreign governments could still exchange dollars for gold until 1971. The next step in the evolution of monetary systems was to break the tie between paper money and gold and create a system of fiat money. <strong>Fiat money</strong> has no intrinsic value like gold or silver–it is simply created by a government decree and becomes the official legal tender of the society. In the United States today, if you take a $100 bill to the government you will not receive any gold or silver–just another $100 bill in return.</p>
<p><a name="commodity-money-term"><strong>Commodity money</strong></a> - A monetary system in which the actual money is a comodity, such as gold or silver.<br> <a name="gold-standard-term"><strong>Gold standard</strong></a> - A monetary system in which gold backs up paper money.<br> <a name="fiat-money-term"><strong>Fiat money</strong></a> - A monetary system in which money has no intrinsic value but is backed by the government.<br></p>
<p>You may wonder what gives money value under a fiat system if it has no intrinsic value. The answer is that the government controls the value of fiat money by controlling its supply in the economy. That is why it is important to prevent counterfeiting. In the next chapter, we see precisely how the government controls the supply of money.</p>
<h3 id="measuring-money-in-the-u.s.-economy">13.1.2 Measuring Money in the U.S. Economy</h3>
<p>In the United States and other modern economies, people can carry out economic transactions in several different ways. In practice, this leads to different measures of money. The most basic measure of money in the United States is called M1. It is the sum of currency in the hands of the public, demand deposits, other checkable deposits, and traveler’s checks. <strong>M1</strong> totaled $3,648 billion in January 2018. Table 13.1 contains the components of M1 and their size; Figure 13.1 shows their relative percentages.</p>

<p>The first part of M1 is currency held by the public, that is, all currency held outside bank vaults. The second component is deposits in checking accounts, called <em>demand deposits</em>. Until the 1980s, checking accounts did not pay interest. The third component, other checkable deposits, was introduced in the early 1980s and did pay interest. Today, the distinction between the two types of deposit accounts is not as meaningful as it used to be because many checking accounts earn interest if the balances are sufficiently high. Finally, traveler’s checks are included in M1 because they are regularly used in economic exchanges.</p>
<p>Most of the currency in the official statistics is not used in ordinary commerce in the United States. Who is using and holding this currency? Some is used in illegal transactions such as the drug trade. Few drug dealers open bank accounts to deposit currency. In addition, a substantial fraction of U.S. currency is held abroad.</p>
<p>M1 does not include all the assets we use to make economic exchanges. <strong>M2</strong> is a somewhat broader definition of money that includes M1 plus deposits in savings accounts, deposits in retail money market mutual funds, and time deposits of less than $100,000. These investment-type assets often can’t readily be used for exchanges without first being converted to M1. In January 2018, M2 totaled $13,836 billion. That’s about four times the total of M1. Figure 13.2 shows the relative sizes of the components of M2.</p>

<p>Economists use different definitions of money because it is not always clear which assets are used primarily as money–that is, which assets are used for economic exchanges and which are used primarily for saving and investing. Money market mutual funds came into existence only in the late 1970s. Some people temporarily “park” their assets in these funds, anticipating they will move them into riskier, higher-earning stock market investments later. Others may use them to earn interest while avoiding the risks of the stock market or bond market. Sometimes, people use money market mutual funds like regular checking accounts or savings accounts. If money market mutual funds are used like checking accounts, they should be considered part of M1. If they are used like savings accounts, however, they should be part of M2. Economists keep an eye on both M1 and M2 because they don’t know precisely how people are using all these money market accounts.</p>
<p>Although consumers commonly use credit cards to make transactions in our economy, they are not part of the money supply. Here’s why: Suppose you have a credit card from the First Union Bank and purchase a new television from an electronics store. As you use your credit card, you are effectively borrowing the amount you charge from the First Union Bank, which, in turn, will pay the electronics store on your behalf. When you receive your credit card bill from the bank, you must begin to pay off the loan. Credit cards enable you to purchase goods now but pay for them at a later date. Unlike money, a credit card is not a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value. Credit cards do make it easier to conduct business, but they are not an official part of the money supply.</p>
<p>What about debit cards? If you own a debit card, you can use it to access the funds you have in your checking account when you make the transaction. When you use your debit card to make a purchase–say, at a supermarket–it is exactly the same thing as writing a check. Thus, a debit card is not an independent source of money. The money supply consists of the balances in checking accounts plus currency held by the public.</p>
<h2 id="how-banks-create-money">13.2 How Banks Create Money</h2>
<h3 id="a-banks-balance-sheet-where-the-money-comes-from-and-where-it-goes">13.2.1 A Bank’s Balance Sheet: Where the Money Comes from and Where It Goes</h3>
<p>A typical commercial bank accepts funds from savers in the form of deposits, for example, in checking accounts. The bank does not leave all these funds idle because if it did it would never make a profit. Instead, the bank turns the money around and loans it out to borrowers. It will be easier to understand how banks create money if we first look at a simplified <strong>balance sheet</strong> for a commercial bank. The balance sheet will show us how the bank raises money and what it does with it.</p>
<p><a name="balance-sheet-term"><strong>Balance sheet</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>An account statement for a bank that shows the sources of its funds (liabilities) as well as the uses of its funds (assets).</li>
</ul>
<p>Balance sheets have two sides: one for assets and one for liabilities. <strong>Liabilities</strong> are the source of funds for the bank. If you open a checking account and deposit your funds in it, the bank is liable for returning the funds to you when you want them. The bank must also pay you interest on the account if you keep enough money in it. Your deposits are therefore the bank’s liabilities. <strong>Assets</strong>, in contrast, generate income for the bank. Loans made by the bank are examples of its assets because borrowers must pay interest on the loans the bank collects.</p>
<p><a name="liabilities-term"><strong>Liabilities</strong></a> - The sources of funds for a bank, including deposits and owner’s equity.<br> <a name="assets-term"><strong>Assets</strong></a> - The uses of the funds of a bank, including loans and reserves.<br></p>
<p>In order to have startup funds when a bank is initially opened, its owners must place their own funds in the bank. We call these funds <strong>owners’ equity</strong>. If the bank subsequently makes a profit, owners’ equity increases; if it loses money, owners’ equity decreases.</p>
<p><a name="owners-equity-term"><strong>Owners’ equity</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The funds provided to a bank by its owners.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the asset side, the bank holds $200 in <strong>reserves</strong>. These are assets that are not lent out. Reserves can be either cash kept in a bank’s vaults or deposits in the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve. Banks are required by law to hold a specific fraction of their deposits as reserves, called <strong>required reserves</strong>. If a bank chooses to hold additional reserves beyond what is required, these are called excess reserves. A bank’s reserves are the sum of its required and excess reserves.</p>
<p><a name="reserves-term"><strong>Reserves</strong></a> - The portion of banks’ deposits set aside in either vault cash or as deposits at the Federal Reserve.<br> <a name="required-reserves-term"><strong>Required reserves</strong></a> - The specific fraction of their deposits that banks are required by law to hold as reserves.<br></p>
<h3 id="how-banks-create-money-1">13.2.2 How Banks Create Money</h3>
<p>To understand the role banks play in determining the supply of money, let’s suppose someone walks into the First Bank of Hollywood and deposits $1,000 in cash to open a checking account. Because currency held by the public and checking deposits are both included in the supply of money, the total money supply has not changed with this transaction. The cash deposited into the checking account reduced the currency held by the public by precisely the amount the checking account increased it.</p>
<p>Now let’s assume banks keep 10 percent of their deposits as reserves. That means the <strong>reserve ratio</strong>–the ratio of reserves to deposits–will be 0.1. The First Bank of Hollywood will keep $100 in reserves and make loans totaling $900. The top panel in Figure 13.4 shows the change in the First Bank of Hollywood’s balance sheet after it has made its loan.</p>
<p><a name="reserve-ratio-term"><strong>Reserve ratio</strong></a></p>

<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-13/figure-13.4.png" alt="Figure 13.4" /><figcaption>Figure 13.4</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Suppose the First Bank of Hollywood loans the funds to an aspiring movie producer. The producer opens a checking account at the First Bank of Hollywood with the $900 he borrowed. He then buys film equipment from a supplier, who accepts his $900 check and deposits it in the Second Bank of Burbank. The next panel in Figure 13.4 shows what happens to the balance sheet of the Second Bank of Burbank. Liabilities increase by the deposit of $900. The bank holds $90 in reserves (10 percent of the $900 deposit) and can lend out $810.</p>
<p>Suppose the Second Bank of Burbank lends the $810 to the owner of a coffeehouse and she opens a checking account there with the $810 as her balance. She then purchases $810 worth of coffee with a check made out to a coffee supplier, who deposits it into the Third Bank of Venice.</p>
<p>The Third Bank of Venice receives a deposit of $810. It keeps $81 in reserves and can lend out $729. This process continues throughout the Los Angeles area with new loans and deposits. The Fourth Bank of Pasadena will receive a deposit of $729, hold $72.90 in reserves, and lend out $656.10. The Fifth Bank of Compton will receive a deposit of $656.10, and the process goes on.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-money-multiplier-works">13.2.3 How the Money Multiplier Works</h3>
<p>The original $1,000 cash deposit has created checking account balances throughout Los Angeles. What’s the total amount? Adding up the new accounts in all the banks (even the ones we have not named), we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\$1,000 + \$900 + \$810 + \$729 + 656.10 + \ldots = \$10,000
\]</span></p>
<p>How did we come up with this sum? It’s from the following simple formula, which we derive in the appendix to this chapter:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ total increase in checking account balance throughout all banks } \\
= (\text{initial cash deposit}) \times \frac{1}{(\text{reserve ratio})}
\]</span></p>
<p>In our example, the reserve ratio is 0.1, so the increase in checking account balances is 1/0.1, or 10 times the initial cash deposit. The initial $1,000 deposit led to a total increase in checking account balances of $10,000 throughout all of the banks.</p>
<p>Recall that the money supply, M1, is the sum of deposits at commercial banks plus currency held by the public. Therefore, the change in the money supply, M1, will be the change in deposits in checking accounts plus the change in currency held by the public. Notice that we referred to “change,” meaning an increase or decrease. Here’s why: In our example, the public, represented by the person who initially made the $1,000 deposit at the First Bank of Hollywood, holds $1,000 less in currency. However, deposits increased by $10,000. Therefore, the money supply, M1, increased by <span class="math inline">\(\$9,000(\$10,000−\$1,000)\)</span>. No single bank lent out more than it had in deposits. Yet, for the banking system as a whole, the money supply expanded by a multiple of the initial cash deposit.</p>
<p>The term 1/reserve ratio in the formula is called the <strong>money multiplier</strong>. It tells us what the total increase in checking account deposits would be for any initial cash deposit. Recall the multiplier for government spending in our demand-side models: An increase in government spending led to larger increases in output through the multiplier. The government-spending multiplier arose because additional rounds of consumption spending were triggered by an initial increase in government spending. In the banking system, an initial cash deposit triggers additional rounds of deposits and lending by banks. This leads to a multiple expansion of deposits.</p>
<p><a name="money-multiplier-term"><strong>Money multiplier</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The ratio of the increase in total checking account desposits to an initial cash deposit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-th-money-multiplier-works-in-reverse">13.2.4 How th Money Multiplier Works in Reverse</h3>
<p>The money-creation process also works in reverse. Suppose you go to your bank and ask for $1,000 in cash from your checking account. The bank must pay you the $1,000. The bank’s liabilities fall by $1,000, but its assets must also fall by $1,000. Withdrawing your $1,000 means two things at the bank. First, if the reserve ratio is 0.1, the bank will reduce its reserves by $100. Second, your $1,000 withdrawal minus the $100 reduction in reserves means the bank has $900 less to lend out. The bank will therefore reduce its loans by $900. With fewer loans, there will be fewer deposits in other banks. The money multiplier working in reverse decreases the money supply.</p>
<p>You may wonder how a bank goes about reducing its outstanding loans. If you had borrowed from a bank to invest in a project for your business, you would not want the bank phoning you to ask for its funds, which are not lying idle but are invested in your business. Banks do not typically call in outstanding loans from borrowers. Instead, if banks cannot tap into their excess reserves when their customers want to withdraw cash, they have to make fewer new loans. In these circumstances, a new potential borrower would find it harder to obtain a loan from the bank.</p>
<h2 id="a-bankers-bank-the-federal-reserve">13.3 A Banker’s Bank: The Federal Reserve</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve System was created in 1913 after a series of financial panics in the United States. Financial panics can occur when there is bad news about the economy or the stability of financial institutions. During these panics, numerous bank runs occurred, depleting the funds on hand that banks could loan out. Severe economic downturns followed.</p>
<p>Congress created the Federal Reserve System to be a <strong>central bank</strong>, or a banker’s bank. One of the Fed’s primary jobs is thus to serve as a <strong>lender of last resort</strong>. When banks need to borrow money during a financial crisis, they can turn to the central bank as a last resort for these funds. If a bank experienced a run, the Federal Reserve could lend it the funds it needed.</p>
<p><a name="central-bank-term"><strong>Central bank</strong></a> - A banker’s bank: an official bank that controls the supply of money in a country.<br> <a name="lender-of-last-resort-term"><strong>Lender of last resort</strong></a> - A central bank is the lender of last resort, the last place, all others having failed, from which banks in emergency situations can obtain loans.<br></p>
<h3 id="functions-of-the-federal-reserve">13.3.1 Functions of the Federal Reserve</h3>
<p>The Federal Reserve has several key functions. Let’s briefly describe them.</p>
<h4 id="the-fed-supplies-currency-to-the-economy">The Fed Supplies Currency to The Economy</h4>
<p>Working through the banking system, the Federal Reserve is responsible for supplying currency to the economy. Although currency is only one component of the money supply, if individuals prefer to hold currency rather than demand deposits, the Federal Reserve and the banking system will facilitate the public’s preferences.</p>
<h4 id="the-fed-provides-a-system-of-check-collection-and-clearing">The Fed Provides a System of Check Collection and Clearing</h4>
<p>The Federal Reserve is responsible for making our system of complex financial transactions work. This means that when Paul writes Freda a check, the Federal Reserve oversees the banks to ensure Freda’s bank receives the funds from Paul’s bank. This is known as check clearing. As our economy moves to more electronic transactions, the Federal Reserve provides oversight over these transactions as well.</p>
<h4 id="the-fed-holds-reserves-from-banks-and-other-depository-institutions-and-regulates-banks">The Fed Holds Reserves from Banks and Other Depository Institutions and Regulates Banks</h4>
<p>As we have seen, banks are required to hold reserves with the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve also serves as a regulator to banks to ensure they are complying with rules and regulations. Ultimately, the Federal Reserve wants to ensure the financial system is safe.</p>
<h4 id="the-fed-conducts-monetary-policy">The Fed Conducts Monetary Policy</h4>
<p>One of the important responsibilities of the Federal Reserve is to conduct <strong>monetary policy</strong>, the range of actions that influences the level of real GDP or inflation.</p>
<p><a name="monetary-policy-term"><strong>Monetary policy</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The range of actions taken by the Federal Reserve to influence the level of GDP or inflation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-structure-of-the-federal-reserve">13.3.2 The Structure of the Federal Reserve</h3>
<p>When members of Congress created the Federal Reserve System, they were aware the institution would be very powerful. Consequently, they deliberately created a structure that attempted to disperse the power, moving it away from major U.S. financial centers (such as New York) to other parts of the country. They divided the United States into 12 Federal Reserve districts, each of which has a <strong>Federal Reserve Bank</strong>. These district banks provide advice on monetary policy, take part in decision making on monetary policy, and act as a liaison between the Fed and the banks in their districts.</p>
<p><a name="federal-reserve-bank-term"><strong>Federal Reserve Bank</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>One of twelve regional banks that are an official part of the Federal Reserve System.</li>
</ul>

<img src="../../../../files/fall-2020/ECON-120/chapter-13/figure-13.5.png" alt="Figure 13.5" /><figcaption>Figure 13.5</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The 12 Federal Reserve Banks are scattered across the United States. These district banks serve as a liaison between the Fed and the banks in their districts. Hawaii and Alaska are in the 12th district, which is headquartered in San Francisco.</p>
<p>There are two other subgroups of the Fed in addition to the Federal Reserve Banks. The <strong>Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve</strong> is the true seat of power in the Federal Reserve System. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the seven members of the board are appointed for 14-year terms by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The chairperson serves a 4-year term as the principal spokesperson for monetary policy in the United States. Financial markets throughout the world anticipate and carefully observe what the chairperson says.</p>
<p><a name="board-of-governors-of-the-federal-reserve-term"><strong>Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The seve-person governing body of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C.</li>
</ul>
<p>The third subgroup of the Fed is the <strong>Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)</strong>, which makes decisions about monetary policy. The FOMC is a 12-person board consisting of the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the presidents of four other regional Federal Reserve Banks. (The presidents of the regional banks other than New York serve on a rotating basis; the seven nonvoting bank presidents attend the meetings and offer their opinions.) The chairperson of the Board of Governors also serves as the chairperson of the FOMC. The FOMC makes the actual decisions on changes in the money supply. Its members are assisted by vast teams of professionals at the Board of Governors and at the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The structure of the Federal Reserve System is depicted in Figure 13.6.</p>

</figure>
<p>On paper, monetary policymaking power appears to be spread throughout the government and the country. In practice, however, the Board of Governors, and especially the chairperson, has the real control. The Board of Governors operates with considerable independence. Presidents and members of Congress can bring political pressures on the Board of Governors, but their 14-year terms tend to insulate the members from external pressures. The current chairman of the Federal Reserve is Jerome Powell, who began his term on February 5, 2018.</p>
<h3 id="the-independence-of-the-federal-reserve">13.3.3 The Independence of the Federal Reserve</h3>
<p>Countries differ in the degree to which their central banks are independent of political authorities. In the United States, the chairperson of the Board of Governors is required to report to Congress on a regular basis, but in practice the Fed makes its own decisions and later informs Congress what it did. The Fed chairperson also often meets with members of the executive branch to discuss economic affairs. Following the Fed’s interventions during the financial crisis, there is increasing interest in Congress to make the Fed disclose additional information.</p>
<p>The central banks in both the United States and the United Kingdom currently operate with considerable independence of elected officials. In other countries, the central bank is part of the treasury department of the government and is potentially subject to more direct political control. There has been a lively debate among economists and political scientists as to whether countries with more independent central banks (banks with less external political pressure) experience less inflation. Central banks that are not independent will always be under pressure to help finance their country’s government deficits by creating money. When central banks succumb to this pressure, the result is inflation. Independence, on the other hand, typically means less inflation.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-federal-reserve-does-during-a-financial-crisis">13.4 What the Federal Reserve Does During a Financial Crisis</h2>
<p>As the lender of last resort, the Fed can quell disturbances in the financial markets. Let’s look at a tool the Fed uses to promote financial stability and the Fed’s actions in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h2>
<p>We began this chapter by examining the role money plays in the economy and how economists define money. We then looked at the flow of money in and out of banks and saw how banks can create money with deposits and loans. Finally, we examined the structure of the Federal Reserve and the key roles that central banks can play during financial crises. Here are the main points you should remember from this chapter:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Money</em> consists of anything we regularly use to make exchanges. In modern economies, money consists primarily of currency and deposits in checking accounts.</li>
<li>Banks are financial intermediaries that earn profits by accepting deposits and making loans. Deposits, which are liabilities of banks, are included in the money supply.</li>
<li>Banks are required by law to hold a fraction of their deposits as reserves, either in cash or in deposits with the Federal Reserve. Total reserves consist of <em>required reserves</em> plus <em>excess reserves</em>.</li>
<li>If there is an increase in reserves in the banking system, the supply of money will expand by a multiple of the initial deposit. This multiple is known as the <em>money multiplier</em>.</li>
<li>Decisions about the supply of money are made at the <em>Federal Open Market Committee</em> (FOMC), which includes the seven members on the Board of Governors and the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, as well as four of the 11 other regional bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis.</li>
<li>In a financial crisis like one that occurred in 2008, the Fed can help stabilize the economy. Current and recent Fed chairmen have been powerful figures in the national economy.</li>
