<h3 id="the-economic-problem-scarce-resources-unlimited-wants">1-1 The Economic Problem: Scarce Resources, Unlimited Wants</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is that although your wants or desires are virtually unlimited, the resources available to satisfy these wants are scares.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Economics</strong> is the study of how people allocate scarce resources, to satisfy their unlimited wants.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong> are the materials we have available to produce things with. In economics, we have four general categories of resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Land</strong> - This covers all natural resources. Also includes sunshine, space, clean air, and the oceans.</li>
<li><strong>Labor</strong> - This includes not just the work time put into production activities but also all that is embodied in that labor. Also referred to as <em>Human Capital</em> or the education, experience and training that someone brings to their labor.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Capital</strong> - Man made resources and it includes machines, tools, office buildings, roads, and factories.</li>
<li><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong> - Refers to that ability to organize the other resources and make them productive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scarce</strong> and <strong>Unlimited</strong>, the two words the discipline of economics revolves around.</p>
<p>A resource is <strong>scarce</strong> when it is not freely available-—that is, when its price exceeds zero.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goods and services that are truly free are not the subject of economics. Without scarcity, there would be no economic problem and no need for prices</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="c-economic-decision-makers-and-markets">1-1c Economic Decision Makers and Markets</h4>
<p>There <strong>four</strong> types of decision makers in the economy. Their interaction determines how an economy’s resources are allocated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Households</strong>
<ul>
<li>Plays the starring role.</li>
<li>As consumers, household demand the goods and services produced. As resource demand the goods and services produced. As resource owners, households supply labor, capital, natural resources and entrepreneurial ability to firms, governments, and the rest of the world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Firms</strong></li>
<li><strong>Governments</strong></li>
<li><strong>The rest of the world</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Firms, governments, and the rest of the world</strong> demand the resources that households supply and then use these resources to supply the goods and services that households demand.</li>
<li>The rest of the world includes foreign households, foreign firms, and foreign governments that supply resources and products to U.S. demanders and demand resources and products from U.S. suppliers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Markets are the means by which buyers and sellers carry out exchange at mutually agreeable terms.</p>
<p>Goods and services are bought and sold in <strong>product markets</strong>. Resources are bought and sold in <strong>resource markets</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>most important</strong> resource market is the <strong>labor, or job, market</strong>. Think about your own experience looking for a job, and you’ll already have some idea of that market.</p>
<h3 id="the-art-of-economic-analysis">1-2 The Art of Economic Analysis</h3>
<h4 id="a-rational-self-interest">1-2a Rational Self-Interest</h4>
<p>In general, <strong>rational self-interest</strong> means that each individual tries to maximize the expected benefit achieved with a given cost or to minimize the expected cost of achieving a given benefit. Thus, economists begin with the assumption that people look out for their self-interest.</p>
<p>For example, a physician who owns a pharmacy prescribes 8 percent more drugs on average than a physician who does not own a pharmacy.</p>
<p>The notion of self-interest does not rule out concern for others; it simply means that concern for others is influenced by the same economic forces that affect other economic choices. <em>The lower the personal cost of helping others, the more help we offer</em>.</p>
<h4 id="c-economic-analysis-is-marginal-analysis">1-2c Economic Analysis is Marginal Analysis</h4>
<ul>
<li>Economic choice is based on a comparison of the expected marginal benefit and the expected marginal cost of the action under consideration. <strong>Marginal</strong> means incremental, additional, or extra. Marginal refers to a change in an economic variable, a change in the status quo.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Microeconomics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is the study of your economic behavior and the economic behavior of others who make choices about such matters as how much to study and how much to party, how much to borrow and how much to save, what to buy and what to sell.</li>
<li>Microeconomics examines individual economic choices and how markets coordinate the choices of various decision makers.</li>
<li>Microeconomics explains how price and quantity are determined in individual markets–the market for breakfast cereal, sports equipment, or used cars, for instance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Macroeconomics</strong> - studies the performance of the economy as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Fluctuations</strong> - Are the rise and fall of economic activity relative to the long-term growth trend of the economy</p>
<h3 id="the-science-of-economic-analysis">1-3 The Science of Economic Analysis</h3>
<h4 id="a-the-role-of-theory">1-3a The Role of Theory</h4>
<p><strong>Economic theory</strong>, or <strong>economic model</strong>, A simplification of reality used to make predictions about cause and effect in the real world</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good theory can act like a closet organizer for your mind, helping you understand a messy and confusing world.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="b-the-scientific-method">1-3b The Scientific Method</h4>
<p>To study economic problems, economists employ a process called the <em>scientific method</em>, which consists of four steps.</p>
<h5 id="step-one-identify-the-question-and-define-relative-variable">Step One: Identify the Question and Define Relative Variable</h5>
<p>The scientific method begins with curiosity. Ask the question about the relationship between two relevant variables and how they affect each other.</p>
<p><strong>Variable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is a measure that can take on different values at different times</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="step-two-specify-assumptions">Step Two: Specify Assumptions</h5>
<p>Specify the assumptions under which the theory is to apply.</p>
<p>One major category of assumptions is the <strong>other-things-constant assumption</strong>–in Latin, the <em>ceteris paribus</em> assumption.</p>
<p>The idea is to identify the variables of interest and then focus exclusively on the relationships among them, assuming that nothing else important changes–that other things remain constant.</p>
<p>We also make assumptions about how people behave; these are called <strong>behavioral assumptions</strong>. The primary behavioral assumption is <em>rational self-interest</em>.</p>
<h5 id="step-three-formulate-a-hypothesis">Step Three: Formulate a Hypothesis</h5>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>is a theory about how key variables relate to each other
<ul>
<li>For example, one hypothesis holds that if the price of Pepsi goes up, other things constant, then the quantity purchased declines.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of this hypothesis, like that of any theory, is to help make predictions about cause and effect in the real world.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="step-four-test-the-hypothesis">Step Four: Test the Hypothesis</h5>
<p>By comparing its predictions with evidence, we test the validity of a hypothesis.</p>
<p>To test a hypothesis, we must focus on the variables in question, while carefully controlling for other effects assumed not to change. The test leads us to either (1) reject the hypothesis, or theory, if it predicts worse than the best alternative theory or (2) use the hypothesis, or theory, until a better one comes along.</p>
<h4 id="c-normative-versus-positive">1-3c Normative Versus Positive</h4>
<p>Economists usually try to explain how the economy works. Sometimes they concern themselves not with how the economy <em>does</em> work but how it <em>should</em> work.</p>
<p><strong>Positive Economic Statement</strong> - A statement that can be proved or disproved by reference to facts. - Concern what is.</p>
<p><strong>Normative Economic Statement</strong> - A statement that reflects an opinion, which cannot be proved or disproved by reference to the facts. - Concern what, in someone’s opinion, should be.</p>
<h4 id="e-predicting-average-behavior">1-3e Predicting Average Behavior</h4>
<p>The goal of economic theory is to predict the impact of economic events on economic choices and, in turn, the effect of these choices on particular markets or on the economy as a whole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The random actions of individuals tend to offset one another, so the average behavior of a large group can be predicted more accurately than the behavior of a particular individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="some-pitfalls-of-faulty-economic-analysis">1-4 Some Pitfalls of Faulty Economic Analysis</h3>
<h4 id="the-fallacy-that-association-is-causation">The Fallacy That Association Is Causation</h4>
<p>The assumption that the event A caused the event B simply because the two are associated in time is committing the <strong>association-is-causation fallacy</strong>, a common error.</p>
<p>The fact that one event precedes another or that the two events occur simultaneously does not necessarily mean that one causes the other.</p>
<h4 id="the-fallacy-of-composition">The Fallacy of Composition</h4>
<p>An erroneous belief that what is true for the individual, or the part, is also true for the group, or the whole.</p>
<p>An assumption to which one infers true of the whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole.</p>
<h4 id="the-mistake-of-ignoring-the-secondary-effects">The Mistake of Ignoring the Secondary Effects</h4>
<p>The mistake is to ignore the secondary effects, or the unintended consequences of an action or a decision.</p>
<p>Economic actions have secondary effects that often turn out to be more important than the primary effects. Secondary effects may develop more slowly and may not be immediately obvious, but good economic analysis tries to anticipate them and take them into account.</p>
<h3 id="if-economists-are-so-smart-why-arent-they-rich">If Economists Are So Smart, Why Aren’t They Rich?</h3>
<p>The economics profession thrives because its models usually do a better job of making economic sense out of a confusing world than do alternative approaches. But not all economists are wealthy, nor is personal wealth the goal of the discipline. In a similar vein, not all doctors are healthy (some even smoke), not all carpenters live in perfectly built homes, not all marriage counselors are happily married, and not all child psychologists have well- adjusted children. Still, those who study economics do reap financial rewards.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-economic-tools-and-economic-system">Chapter 2: Economic Tools and Economic System</h2>
<h3 id="economic-systems">2-4 Economic Systems</h3>
<h4 id="b-pure-capitalism">2-4b Pure Capitalism</h4>
<p>Under <strong>pure capitalism</strong>, there is no government. The rules of the game include the private ownership of resources and the market distribution of products. - Owners have <strong>property rights</strong> to the <strong>use of their resources</strong> and are therefore free to supply those resources to the <strong>highest bidder</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Private property rights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>allow individual owners to use resources or to charge others for their use</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consumers are free to buy whatever goods they can afford</strong>. All this voluntary buying and selling is coordinated by unrestricted markets, where buyers and sellers make their intentions known.</p>
<p>Under pure capitalism, markets answer the what, how, and for whom questions. That’s why capitalism is also referred to as a market system.</p>
<h5 id="flaws-of-pure-capitalism">Flaws of Pure Capitalism</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li>No central authority protects property rights, enforces contracts, and otherwise ensures that the rules of the game are followed.</li>
<li>People with no resources to sell could starve. 3. Some producers may try to monopolize markets by eliminating the competition.</li>
<li>The production or consumption of some goods involves side effects that can harm or benefit people not involved in the market transaction.</li>
<li>Firms have no incentive to produce the so-called public goods, such as national defense, because private firms cannot prevent non-payers from enjoying the benefits of public goods.</li>
<li>Market economies experience economic fluctuations, which are alternating periods of expansions and recessions in their level of economic activity, especially in employment and production.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="c-pure-command-system">2-4c Pure Command System</h4>
<p>In a <strong>pure command system</strong>, resources are directed and production is coordinated not by market forces but by the “command,” or central plan, of government.</p>
<h5 id="flaws-of-pure-command-system">Flaws of Pure Command System</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li>Running an economy is so complicated and requires so much information that some resources are used inefficiently.</li>
<li>Because nobody in particular owns resources, each person has less incentive to employ them in their highest-valued use, so some resources are wasted.</li>
<li>Central plans may be more reflective of the preferences of central planners, who in many cases are unelected dictators, than the preferences of society.</li>
<li>Because government is responsible for all production, the variety of products tends to be more limited than in a capitalist economy.</li>
<li>Each individual has less personal freedom in making economic choices.</li>
<li>Because profit has no place in a command economy, people have less incentive to invent new and better products or find more efficient ways to make existing products.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-is-economy">What is Economy?</h2>
<p><strong>Economy</strong> is that sphere of social activity involved in the <em>production, distribution and consumption</em> of material goods and services. ### The Three Functions of an Economic System</p>
<p>All economic activities answer one or more of the following questions that must be addressed by an economic system.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>What to Produce?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to Produce it?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to Distribute the Output?</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="types-of-economic-system">Types of Economic System</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Traditional Economies</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Characterized by <strong>subsistence</strong>. Individuals produce for themselves most of the things that they consume and if they need something they cannot make they will barter for it. The three economic functions are answered by current needs and traditions.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Feudal Economies</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>are organized around <strong>land ownership</strong>. Workers are attached to the land where they are born. If land is transferred, they stay with the land. Most of the important economic decisions are made by the landowners.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Slave Economies</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In slave economies, labor is viewed as property. Those who own the slaves make the important economic decisions.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>Market or Capitalist Economies</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Market economies have <em>three</em> main characteristics; wage labor, private ownership of the means of production and exchange is done through markets.</li>
<li>Markets are <strong>coordinated by price and decisions are decentralized</strong>, that is each individual makes his own economic decisions.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><strong>Socialist Economies or Command Economies</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Characterized by <strong>public ownership</strong> of the means of production and central planning. These economies have a planning bureau that makes the important economic decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-do-markets-perform-the-three-functions-of-an-economic-system">How do Markets Perform the Three Functions of an Economic System?</h3>
<p>In *Market Economies** the question,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>What to Produce?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>is answered by what <strong>consumers demand</strong>. In market economies producers are motivated to produce what buyers want, so that is what they produce.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>How to Produce it?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>is answered by <strong>producers seeking the most cost efficient method to produce the output</strong>. Producers want to stay in business, so they look to provide the consumer with what he wants at the lowest cost.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>How to Distribute the output?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>is answered by the <strong>willingness and ability of consumers to demand the output</strong>. In order to have a demand for something a consumer has to both want it and be able to pay for it. If a consumer doesn’t demand a good it will not get produced. This goes back to that first economic function, What to produce?. Markets will only produce what consumers demand, so if someone is too poor to demand something it doesn’t get produced.</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings us to one of the most important characteristics of markets; Markets are very <strong>EFFICIENT</strong> but they are <em>not</em> necessarily <strong>EQUITABLE</strong> in the distribution of the output.</p>
<p>Market economies are very efficient. Producers are motivated to produce what consumers want so there aren’t a lot of shortages or surpluses of goods. Producers are also motivated to find the most cost efficient methods to produce those goods. Resources don’t get wasted.</p>
<p>However the distribution of the output is dependent on the distribution of income which in many cases is dependent on chance. The result is that the distribution of the output could end up to be highly inequitable. This was one of Marx’s main criticisms of capitalism and why communism was favored in some countries.</p>
<p>On the other hand Markets are preferred by many despite this shortcoming because they consider markets with its decentralized decision making as freer and more supportive of democratic institutions.</p>
