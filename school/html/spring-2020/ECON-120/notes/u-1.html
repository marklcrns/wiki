<blockquote>
<p>The problem is that although your wants, or desires, are virtually unlimited, the resources available to satisfy these wants are scares.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Economics</strong> is the study of how people allocate scarce resources, to satisfy their unlimited wants.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong> are the materials we have available to produce things with. In economics, we have four general categories of resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Land</strong> - This covers all natural resources. Also includes sunshine, space, clean air, and the oceans.</li>
<li><strong>Labor</strong> - This includes not just the work time put into production activities but also all that is embodied in that labor. Also referred to as <em>Human Capital</em> or the education, experience and training that someone brings to their labor.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Capital</strong> - Man made resources and it includes machines, tools, office buildings, roads, and factories.</li>
<li><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong> - Refers to that ability to organize the other resources and make them productive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scarce</strong> and <strong>Unlimited</strong>, the two words the discipline of economics revolves around.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-economy">What is Economy?</h2>
<p><strong>Economy</strong> is that sphere of social activity involved in the <em>production, distribution and consumption</em> of material goods and services.</p>
