<p><a name="monopoly"><strong>Monopoly</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>A market in which a single firm sells a product that does not have any close substitutes.</li>
<li>In contrast with a perfectly competitive, or price-taking, firm, a monopolist controls the price of its product, so we can refer to a monopolist as a <em>price maker</em>.</li>
<li>A monopolist has market power, the ability to affect the price of its product.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="market-power"><strong>Market power</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The ability of a firm to affect the price of its product.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="barrier-to-entry"><strong>Barrier to entry</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Something that prevents firms entering a profitable market.</li>
</ul>
<p>A monopoly occurs when a barrier to entry prevents a second firm from entering a profitable market. Among the possible barriers to entry are patents, network externalities, government licensing, the ownership or control of a key resource, and large economies of scale in production:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>patent</strong> grants an inventor the exclusive right to sell a new product for some period of time, currently 20 years under international rules.</li>
<li>When the value of a product to a consumer increases with the number of consumers who use it, <strong>network externalities</strong> are at work. For example, the larger the number of people on an online social network, the greater the opportunities for interaction. Similarly, the larger the number of people using a software application such as a word processor, the greater the opportunities to share files. Network externalities provide an advantage to existing firms and may inhibit the entry of new ones.</li>
<li>Under a licensing policy, the government chooses a single firm to sell a particular product. Some examples are licensing for radio and television stations, off-street parking in cities, and vendors in national parks.</li>
<li>If a firm owns or controls a key resource, the firm can prevent entry by refusing to sell the input to other firms. The classic example is DeBeers, the South African company that controls about 80 percent of the worldâ€™s production of diamonds. Before the 1940s, the Aluminum Company of AmericaALCOAhad long-term contracts to buy most of the worldâ€™s available bauxite, a key input to the production of aluminum.</li>
<li>A <strong>natural monopoly</strong> occurs when the scale economies in production are so large that only a single large firm can earn a profit. The market can support only one profitable firm because if a second firm entered the market, both firms would lose money. Some examples are cable TV service, electricity transmission, and water systems.</li>

</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Marginal revenue equals the price for the first unit sold, but is less than the price for additional units sold. To sell an additional unit, the firm cuts the price and receives less revenue on the units that could have been sold at the higher price. The marginal revenue is positive for the first four units, and negative for larger quantities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trade-offs faced by a monopolist in cutting the price to sell a larger quantity. When the firm cuts its price from $12 to $10, there is good news and bad news:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good news</strong>: The firm collects $10 from the new customer (the third), so revenue increases by $10.</li>
<li><strong>Bad news</strong>: The firm cuts the price for all its customers, so it gets less revenue from the customers who would have been willing to pay the higher price of $12. Specifically, the firm collects $2 less from each of the two original customers, so revenue from the original customers decreases by $4.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our discussion of good news and bad news has revealed a key feature of a monopoly: Marginal revenue is less than price. To sell one more unit, the monopolist must cut its price, and the difference between marginal revenue and price is the bad newsâ€“the loss in revenue from consumers who would have bought the good at the higher price. In fact, this is true for any firm that must cut its price to sell more.</p>
<p>If a perfectly competitive firm sells one unit at $12, it can sell a second unit at the same price, so its marginal revenue is $12 for the second unit sold, just as it was $12 for the first unit sold. For a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue is always equal to the price, no matter how many units the firm sells. A perfectly competitive firm does not cut the price to sell more, so there is no bad news associated with selling more.</p>
<h3 id="a-formula-for-marginal-revenue">10.1.2 A formula for Marginal Revenue</h3>
<p>We can use a simple formula to compute marginal revenue. The formula quantifies the good news and bad news from selling one more unit:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{marginal revenue} = \text{new price} + (\text{slope of demand curve}
\times \text{old quantity})
\]</span></p>
<p>The first part of the formula is the good news, the money received for the extra unit sold. The second part is the bad news from selling one more unit, the revenue lost by cutting the price for the original customers. The revenue change equals the price change required to sell one more unitthe slope of the demand curve, which is a negative numbertimes the number of original customers who get a price cut.</p>
<p>Suppose the monopolist wants to increase the quantity sold from two to three, so it cuts the price from $12 to $10. The new price is $10, the old quantity is two units, and the slope of the demand curve is -$2, so marginal revenue is $6:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{marginal revenue} = \$10 - (\$2\text{ per unit} \times 2 \text{ units}) = \$6
\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, to sell the fifth unit, the firm would cut the price from $8 to $6, and marginal revenue is actually negative:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{marginal revenue} = \$6 - (\$2 \text{ per unit} \times 4 \text{units} =
-\$2
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="using-the-marginal-principle">10.1.3 Using the Marginal Principle</h3>
<p>A monopolist can use the <a href="ch-2.html#the-marginal-principle">marginal principle</a> to decide how much output to produce.</p>

</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>To maximize profit, the monopolist picks point a, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The monopolist produces 900 doses per hour at a price of $15 (point b). The average cost is $8 (point c), so the profit per dose is $7 (equal to the $15 price minus the $8 average cost) and the total profit is $6,300 (equal to $7 per dose times 900 doses). The profit is shown by the shaded rectangle.</p>

<p>We can use the marginal-revenue formula explained earlier to compute marginal revenue for different quantities of output:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{marginal revenue} = new price + (\text{slope of demand curve} \times
\text{old quantity})
\]</span></p>
<p>For example, at a price of $18, the quantity sold is 600 doses, so marginal revenue is $12:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{marginal revenue} = \$18 - (\$0.01 \times \text{600 doses}) = \$12
\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, at a price of $15, the quantity is 900 doses and marginal revenue is $6:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{marginal revenue} = \$15 - (\$0.01 \times \text{900 doses}) = \$6
\]</span></p>
<p>We can compute the firmâ€™s profit in two ways. First, profit equals total revenue minus total cost:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{profit} = \text{total revenue} - \text{total cost} \\
\text{profit} = \text{\$15 per dose} \times \text{900 doses} - \text{\$8 per
dose} \times \text{900 doses} = \$6,300
\]</span></p>
<p>Second, we can compute the profit per dose and multiply it by the number of doses:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{profit} = \text{profit per dose} \times \text{quantity of doses}
\]</span></p>
<p>The profit per dose is the price minus the average cost: <span class="math inline">\(\$7 = \$15 - \$8\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{profit} = \text{\$7 per dose} \times \text{900 doses} = \$6,300
\]</span></p>
<p>Why should the firm stop at 900 doses? Beyond 900 doses, the marginal revenue from an additional dose will be less than the marginal cost associated with producing it. Although the firm could cut its price and sell a larger quantity, an additional dose would add less to revenue than it adds to cost, so the firmâ€™s total profit would decrease. As shown in the fifth row in the table in Figure 10.2, the firm could sell 1,000 doses at a price of $14, but the marginal revenue at this quantity is only $4, while the marginal cost at this quantity is $6.70. Producing the 1,000th dose would decrease the firmâ€™s profit by $2.70.</p>
<p>The three-step process how a monopolist picks a quantity and how to compute the monopoly profit:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Find the quantity that satisfies the marginal principle, that is, the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In the example shown in Figure 10.2, marginal revenue equals marginal cost at point a, so the monopolist produces 900 doses.</li>
<li>Using the demand curve, find the price associated with the monopolistâ€™s chosen quantity. In Figure 10.2, the price required to sell 900 doses is $15 (point b).</li>
<li>Compute the monopolistâ€™s profit. The profit per unit sold equals the price minus the average cost, and the total profit equals the profit per unit times the number of units sold. In Figure 10.2, the profit is shown by the shaded rectangle, with height equal to the profit per unit sold and width equal to the number of units sold.</li>

</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>A switch from perfect competition to monopoly increases the price from $8 to $18 and decreases the quantity sold from 400 to 200 doses. Consumer surplus decreases by an amount shown by the areas B and D, while profit increases by the amount shown by rectangle B. The net loss to society is shown by triangle D, the deadweight loss from monopoly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can use some simple geometry to compute the reduction in consumer surplus. The formula for the area of a rectangle is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{area of rectangle} = \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]</span></p>
<p>In Figure 10.4, the base of rectangle B is 200 and the height is $10, so the area is $2,000:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{area of rectangle B} = \text{200 doses} \times \text{\$10 per dose} =
\$2,000
\]</span></p>
<p>The switch to monopoly increases the price by $10 per dose, so consumers pay $10 extra on the 200 doses they buy from the monopolist, resulting in a loss of $2,000. The other part of the consumer loss is triangle D. The formula for the area of a triangle is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{area of triangle} = 1/2 \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]</span></p>
<p>In Figure 10.4, the base of triangle D is 200 and the height is $10, so the area is $1,000:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{area of triangle D} = 1/2 \times \text{200 doses} \times \text{\$10 per
dose} = \$1,000
\]</span></p>
<p>The monopolistâ€™s profit per dose is $10, the $18 price minus the $8 average cost. The monopolistâ€™s profit is $2,000:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{profit} = \text{\$10 per dose} \times \text{200 doses} = \$2,000
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>This $2,000 gain by the monopolist comes at the expense of consumers.</strong></p>

<h3 id="rent-seeking-using-resources-to-get-monopoly-power">10.2.2 Rent Seeking: Using Resources to Get Monopoly Power</h3>
<p>Another source of inefficiency from a monopoly is the use of resources to acquire monopoly power. Because a monopoly is likely to earn a profit, firms are willing to spend money to <strong>persuade the government to erect barriers to entry</strong> that grant monopoly power through licenses, franchises, and tariffs.</p>
<p>One way to get monopoly power is to hire <em>lobbyists</em> to persuade legislators and other policymakers to grant monopoly power</p>
<p><a name="rent-seeking"><strong>Rent seeking</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The process of using public policy to gain economic profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rent seeking is inefficient because it uses resources that could be used in other ways. For example, the people employed as lobbyists could instead produce goods and services.</p>
<h3 id="monopoly-and-public-policy">10.2.3 Monopoly and Public Policy</h3>
<p>Given the social costs of monopoly, the government uses a number of policies to intervene in markets dominated by a single firm or likely to become a monopoly. In the case of natural monopolyâ€“a market that can support only a single firmâ€“the government can intervene by regulating the price the natural monopolist charges. In other markets, the government uses antitrust policies to break monopolies into smaller companies and prevent corporate mergers that would lead to others. These policies are designed to promote competition, leading to lower prices and more production.</p>
<h2 id="patents-and-monopoly-power">10.3 Patents and Monopoly Power</h2>
<p>One source of monopoly power is a government patent that gives a firm the exclusive right to produce a product for 20 years.</p>
<p>If the monopoly profits are large enough to offset the substantial research and development costs of a new product, a firm will develop the product and become a monopolist. Granting monopoly power through a patent may be efficient from a social perspective because it may encourage the development of products that would otherwise not be developed.</p>
<h3 id="trade-offs-from-patents">10.3.2 Trade-Offs from Patents</h3>
<p>Looking back at Figure 10.4, a monopolist produces 200 doses per hour instead of 400. From societyâ€™s perspective, 400 doses are better than 200 doses, but we donâ€™t have that choice. Flexjoint wonâ€™t develop the drug unless a patent protects the firm from competition for at least 7 years. Therefore, societyâ€™s choice is between the monopoly outcome of 200 doses or 0 doses. Because a quantity of 200 doses is clearly better than none, <strong>the patent is beneficial from societyâ€™s perspective</strong>.</p>
<p>Suppose it still takes Flexjointâ€™s competitors 3 years to develop a substitute, and Flexjointâ€™s profit per year is still $2 million. Without a patent, Flexjoint would earn an economic profit of $6 million during its 3-year monopoly ($2 million per year times 3 years), which is more than the $5 million cost of research and development. Therefore, the firm would develop the new drug even without a patent. In this case, a <strong>patent would merely prolong a monopoly, and so it would be inefficient from societyâ€™s perspective</strong>.</p>
<p>What are the general conclusions about the merits of the patent system? It is sensible for a government to grant a patent for a product that would otherwise not be developed, but it is not sensible for other products. Unfortunately, <strong>no one knows in advance whether a particular product would be developed without a patent, so the government canâ€™t be selective in granting patents</strong>. In some cases, patents lead to new products, although in other cases, they merely prolong monopoly power.</p>
<h2 id="price-discrimination">10.4 Price Discrimination</h2>
<p><a name="price-discrimination"><strong>Price discrimination</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The practice of selling a good at different prices to different consumers.
<ul>
<li>For example, airlines offer discount tickets to travelers who are flexible in their departure times, and movie theaters have lower prices for senior citizens. The only legal restriction on price discrimination is that a firm cannot use it to drive rival firms out of business.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Although price discrimination is widespread, it is not always possible. A firm has an opportunity for price discrimination if three conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Market power</strong>. The firm must have some control over its price, facing a negatively sloped demand curve for its product. Although we discuss price discrimination by a monopolist, any firm that faces a negatively sloped demand curve can charge different prices to different consumers. In fact, the only type of firm that cannot engage in price discrimination is a perfectly competitive price-taking firm. Such a firm faces a horizontal demand curve, taking the market price as given. For all other types of marketsâ€“monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competitionâ€“price discrimination is possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Different consumer groups</strong>. Consumers must differ in their willingness to pay for the product or in their responsiveness to changes in price, as measured by the price elasticity of demand. In addition, the firm must be able to identify different groups of consumers. For example, an airline must be able to distinguish between business travelers and tourists, and a movie theater must be able to distinguish between seniors and nonseniors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resale is not possible</strong>. It must be impractical for one consumer to resell the product to another consumer. Airlines prohibit consumers from buying and reselling tickets. If airlines allowed consumers to sell discount tickets to each other, you could go into business as a ticket broker, buying discount airline tickets one month ahead and then selling them to business travelers one week before the travel date. In general, the possibility of resale causes price discrimination to break down.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One approach to price discrimination is to identify consumers who are not willing to pay the regular price and offer them a discount. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Discounts on airline tickets</strong>. Airlines offer discount tickets to travelers who spend Saturday night away from home because they are likely to be tourists, not business travelers. The typical tourist is not willing to pay as much for air travel as the typical business traveler. Airlines also offer discount tickets to people who plan weeks ahead because tourists plan further ahead than business travelers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discount coupons for groceries and restaurant food</strong>. The typical coupon-clipper is not willing to pay as much as the typical consumer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manufacturersâ€™ rebates for appliances</strong>. A person who takes the trouble to mail a rebate form to the manufacturer is not willing to pay as much as the typical consumer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Senior-citizen discounts on airline tickets, restaurant food, drugs, and entertainment</strong>. Some seniors have more time to shop for bargains, and are thus more sensitive to prices. Other seniors have relatively low income, and are willing to pay less than the typical consumer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Student discounts on movies and concerts</strong>. The typical student has less income than the typical consumer, and is thus willing to pay less for movies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge for a firm is to figure out which groups of consumers should get discounts. Firms can experiment with different prices and identify groups of consumers that are most sensitive to price. Online retailers such as amazon.com vary prices randomly to see how consumers respond to price changes. Once an online retailer finds a pattern of consumer responses, the retailer can charge different prices to different consumers, depending on their characteristics as revealed by their online activity. For example, in late 2015, as pumpkin-pie season approached, Amazonâ€™s price of pumpkin-pie spice was either $4.49 or $8.99, depending on when you looked. Amazon used the information collected in its pumpkin-spice price experiments to refine its pricing strategy. In principle, <strong>Amazon could use the data collected to develop systems of price discrimination, giving discounts to the most price-sensitive consumers</strong>. Other online retailers could also utilize customer data to engage in personal price discrimination.</p>

</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>To engage in price discrimination, the firm divides potential customers into two groups and applies the marginal principle twiceâ€“once for each group. Using the marginal principle, the profit-maximizing prices are $3 for seniors (point b) and $6 for nonseniors (point d).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="price-discrimination-and-the-elasticity-of-demand">10.4.2 Price Discrimination and the Elasticity of Demand</h3>
<p>We can use the concept of <a href="ch-5.html#price-elasticity-of-demand">price elasticity of demand</a> to explain why price discrimination increases the restaurantâ€™s profit.</p>
<p>Suppose the restaurant initially has a single price of $5 for both seniors and nonseniors. Compared to other consumers, senior citizens have more elastic demand for restaurant meals, in part because they have lower income and more time to shop for low prices. A price cut for senior citizens brings good news and bad news for the restaurant:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Good news</strong>: Demand is highly elastic, so total revenue increases by a large amount.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bad news</strong>: More meals are served, so total cost increases.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the senior demand for meals is highly elasticâ€“that is, <span class="math inline">\(E_d\)</span> is well above 1.0 the good news will dominate the bad news: The increase in revenue will more than offset the increase in cost. Consequently, a price cut will increase the firmâ€™s profit.</p>
<p>For nonseniors, the firm will have an incentive to increase the price above the initial common price of $5. Suppose nonseniors have a mildly elastic demand for meals, with <span class="math inline">\(E_d\)</span> just above 1.0. A price hike for nonseniors brings bad news on the revenue side and good news on the cost side:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bad news</strong>: Demand is mildly elastic, so total revenue decreases by a small amount.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Good news</strong>: Fewer meals are served, so total cost decreases.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the demand by nonseniors is mildly elastic, the good news will dominate the bad news: The savings in production costs will exceed the revenue loss. Consequently, the price hike for nonseniors will increase the firmâ€™s profit.</p>
<h3 id="examples-movie-admission-versus-popcorn-and-hardback-versus-paperback-books">10.4.3 Examples: Movie Admission versus Popcorn, and Hardback versus Paperback Books</h3>
<p>Why do senior citizens pay less than everyone else for admission to a movie, but the same as everyone else for popcorn? As weâ€™ve seen, a senior discount is not an act of generosity by a firm, but an act of profit maximization. Senior citizens are typically willing to pay less than other citizens for movies, so a theater divides its consumers into two groupsâ€“seniors and othersâ€“and offers a discount to seniors.</p>
