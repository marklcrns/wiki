<h2 id="the-price-elasticity-of-demand">5.1 The Price Elasticity of Demand</h2>
<p><a name="price-elasticity-of-demand"><strong>Price elasticity of demand (<span class="math inline">\(E_d\)</span>)</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>A measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to changes in price; equal to the absolute values of the percentage change in quantity demanded.</li>
<li>Result will always be a negative value, since the law of demand states that when supply rises, demand falls.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E_{d} = \left |\frac{\text{percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{percentage change in price}}\right |
\]</span></p>
<p>When the price elasticity is listed as a positive number, the interpretation of the elasticity is straightforward. If the elasticity number is large, it means that the demand for the product is very elastic, or very responsive to changes in price. In contrast, a small number indicates that the demand for a product is very inelastic.</p>
<h3 id="computing-percentage-changes-and-elasticities">Computing Percentage Changes and Elasticities</h3>
<p>Two ways to compute percentage change:</p>
<p>For example, if a price increases from $20 to $22.</p>
<p><a name="initial-value-method"><strong>Initial-value method</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{percent change with initial value} = \frac{22 - 20}{20} \cdot 100 = \frac{2}{20} \cdot 100 = 10\%
\]</span></p>
<p><a name="midpoint-method"><strong>Midpoint method</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{percentage change with midpoint value} = \frac{\left | 22 - 20 \right |}{\frac{20 + 22}{2}} \cdot 100 = \frac{2}{21} \cdot 100 = 9.52\%
\]</span></p>
<p>The advantage of the midpoint approach is that it generates the same absolute percentage change whether the variable has increased or decreased. The reason is that the denominator is the same in both cases. In contrast, the initial-value computation is based on the initial value, so our answer there depends on the direction of the change–which of the two values is the initial value.</p>
<h3 id="price-elasticity-and-the-demand-curve">5.1.2 Price Elasticity and the Demand Curve</h3>
<p><a name="elastic-demand"><strong>Elastic demand</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The price elasticity of demand is greater than one, so the percentage change in quantity exceeds the percentage change in price.</li>
<li>When the price elasticity is greater than 1.0, we say that demand is <em>elastic</em>, or highly responsive to changes in price.
<ul>
<li>e.g. Restaurant meals, air travel and movies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="inelastic-demand"><strong>Inelastic demand</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The price elasticity of demand is less than one, so the percentage change in quantity is less than the percentage change in price.</li>
<li>When the elasticity is less than 1.0, we say that demand is <em>inelastic</em>, or not very responsive to changes in price.
<ul>
<li>e.g. Salt, eggs, coffee and cigarettes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="unit-elastic-demand"><strong>Unit elastic demand</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The price elasticity of demand is one, so the percentage change in quantity equals the percentage change in price.
<ul>
<li>e.g. Housing and fruit juice.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="perfectly-inelastic-demand"><strong>Perfectly inelastic demand</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The price elasticity of demand is zero.</li>
<li>When demand is <em>perfectly inelastic</em>, the quantity doesn’t change as the price changes, so the demand curve is vertical at the fixed quantity.</li>
<li>This extreme case is rare because for most products, consumers can either switch to a substitute good or do without.
<ul>
<li>e.g. Medicines such as insulin for diabetics that have no substitutes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="perfectly-elastic-demand"><strong>Perfectly elastic demand</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The price elasticity of demand is infinite.</li>
<li>In the case of perfect elasticity, the price elasticity is infinite and the demand curve is horizontal, meaning that only one price is possible.
<ul>
<li>e.g. Each wheat farmer can sell as much as he or she wants at the market price but would sell nothing at any price above the market price.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="elasticity-and-the-availability-of-substitutes">5.1.3 Elasticity and the Availability of Substitutes</h3>
<p>The key factor in determining the price elasticity for a particular product is the availability of substitute products.</p>
<p>Consider the substitution possibilities for insulin and cornflakes. There are no good substitutes for insulin, so diabetics are not very responsive to changes in price. When the price of insulin increases, they cannot switch to another medicine, so the demand for insulin is inelastic. In contrast, there are many substitutes for cornflakes, including different types of corn cereals, as well as cereals made from wheat, rice, and oats. Faced with an increase in the price of cornflakes, consumers can easily switch to substitute products, so the demand for cornflakes is relatively elastic.</p>
<p>The availability of substitutes increases over time, so the longer the time consumers have to respond to a price change, the more elastic the demand. Because it often takes time for consumers to respond to price changes, the short-run price elasticity of demand is typically smaller than the long-run elasticity. For example, when the price of gasoline increases, consumers can immediately drive fewer miles in their existing cars or switch to public transportation. As shown in Table 5.2, the short-run price elasticity of demand for gasoline is 0.25. In the long run, consumers can buy more fuel-efficient cars and move closer to workplaces. As time passes, consumers have more options to cut gasoline consumption–more substitution possibilities–so demand becomes more elastic.</p>

<h3 id="other-determinants-of-the-price-elasticity-of-demand">5.1.4 Other Determinants of the Price Elasticity of Demand</h3>
<p>Two other factors help determine the price elasticity of demand for a product:</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Budget</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a good represents a small part of the budget of the typical consumer, demand is relatively inelastic. For example, suppose the price of pencils is 20 cents and then increases by 10 percent, or 2 cents. Because the price change is tiny compared to the income of the typical consumer, we would expect a relatively small decrease in the quantity of pencils demanded. In contrast, if the price of a car is $20,000 and then increases 10 percent ($2,000), we would expect a bigger response because the change in price is large relative to the income of the typical consumer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Necessity or a luxury good</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The demand for food, a necessity, is relatively low in both wealthy and poor countries. Similarly, the demand for physician visits is inelastic (elasticity=0.25). In contrast, the elasticity of demand for luxury goods such as restaurant meals, foreign travel, and motorboats is relatively elastic.</li>

<h3 id="predicting-changes-in-quantity">5.2.1 Predicting Changes in Quantity</h3>
<p>If we have values for two of the three variables in the elasticity formula, we can compute the value of the third. The three variables are (1) the price elasticity of demand itself, (2) the percentage change in quantity, and (3) the percentage change in price.</p>
<p><strong>Elasticity Formula</strong> <span class="math display">\[
\text{percentage change in quantity demanded} = \text{percentage change in price} \times E_d
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="price-elasticity-and-total-revenue">5.2.2 Price Elasticity and Total Revenue</h3>
<p><strong>Total revenue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The money a firm generates from selling its product.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{total revenue} = \text{price per unit} \times  \text{quantity sold}
\]</span></p>
<p>Suppose a firm increases the price of its product. Will its total sales revenue increase or decrease? The answer depends on the price elasticity of demand for the product. If you know the price elasticity, you can determine whether a price hike will increase or decrease the firm’s total revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Elastic demand</em>. The relationship between price and total revenue is negative: An increase in price decreases total revenue; a decrease in price increases total revenue.</li>
<li><em>Inelastic demand</em>. The relationship between price and total revenue is positive: An increase in price increases total revenue; a decrease in price decreases total revenue.</li>
<li><em>Unit elastic demand</em>. Total revenue does not vary with price.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-elasticities-of-demand">5.4 Other Elasticities of Demand</h2>
<h3 id="income-elasticity-of-demand">5.4.1 Income Elasticity of Demand</h3>
<p><strong>Income elasticity of demand</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A measure of the responsiveness of demand to changes in consumer income; equal to the percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E_t = \frac{\text{percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{percentage change in income}}
\]</span></p>
<p>If the income elasticity is <em>positive</em>–indicating a positive relationship between income and demand–we say that the good is normal. New cars and new clothes are products that have positive income elasticities and are thus considered normal goods. In contrast, if the income elasticity is <em>negative</em>–indicating a negative relationship between income and demand–we say the good is “inferior.” Some examples of inferior goods are intercity bus travel, used clothing, and used cars.</p>
<h3 id="cross-price-elasticity-of-demand">5.4.2 Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand</h3>
<p><strong>Cross-price elasticity of demand</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A measure of the responsiveness of demand to changes in the price of another good; equal to the percentage change in the quantity demanded of one good
<ol start="24" type="A">
<li>divided by the percentage change in the price of another good (Y).</li>

<h2 id="the-price-elasticity-of-supply">5.5 The Price Elasticity of Supply</h2>
<p><strong>Price elasticity of supply</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A measure of the responsiveness of the quantity supplied to changes in price; equal to the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.</li>
<li>Result will always be a positive value.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-role-of-time-short-run-versus-long-run-supply-elasticity">5.5.2 The Role of Time: Short-Run versus Long-Run Supply Elasticity</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Short run</em>. A higher price encourages existing firms to increase their output by purchasing more materials and hiring more workers.</li>
<li><em>Long run</em>. New firms enter the market and existing firms expand their production facilities to produce more output.</li>
</ul>
<p>The short-run response is limited because of <a href="ch-2#2.4%20The%20Principle%20of%20Diminishing%20Returns">The principle of diminishing returns</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the short run, the fixed input is the firm’s production facility. Although a higher price will induce firms to produce more, the response is limited by the fixed capacity of the firms’ production facilities. As a result, the short-run supply curve is relatively steep and the short-run supply elasticity is relatively small.</li>
</ul>
<p>The long-run supply response to an increase in price is not limited by diminishing returns because production facilities are not fixed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Over time, new firms enter the market with new production facilities and old firms build new facilities. As a result, a given increase in price generates a larger increase in quantity supplied. The long-run supply curve will be relatively flat and the elasticity of supply will be relatively large.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extreme-cases-perfectly-inelastic-supply-and-perfectly-elastic-supply">5.5.3 Extreme Cases: Perfectly Inelastic Supply and Perfectly Elastic Supply</h3>
<p><strong>Perfectly inelastic supply</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The price elasticity of supply equals zero.</li>
<li>Vertical supply curve</li>
<li>Land is an example of a product that has a perfectly inelastic supply. In the words of American humorist and author Will Rogers, “The trouble with land is that they’re not making it anymore.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Perfectly elastic supply</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The price elasticity of supply is equal to infinity.</li>
<li>A horizontal supply curve indicates that the marginal cost of production doesn’t change as the total output of the industry increases. For example, if the production cost per pencil is $0.20 no matter how many pencils the industry produces, the supply curve will be horizontal at $0.20.</li>

<p>Under what conditions will an <strong>increase in demand</strong> cause a relatively small increase in price?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Small increase in demand</em>. If the shift of the demand curve is relatively small, the gap between the new demand and the old supply will be relatively small, and the small excess demand can be eliminated with a relatively small increase in price.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Highly elastic demand</em>. If consumers are very responsive to changes in price, the increase in price caused by excess demand will cause a large reduction in the quantity demanded. As a result, the excess demand will be eliminated with a relatively small increase in price.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Highly elastic supply</em>. If producers are very responsive to changes in price, the increase in price caused by excess demand will cause a large increase in the quantity supplied. As a result, the excess demand will be eliminated with a relatively small increase in price.</p></li>
