<ul>
<li>A buyer or seller that takes the market price as given.
<ul>
<li>For example, each soybean farmer takes the market price as given. There is no reason to cut the price to sell more soybeans, because the farmer can sell as much as he wants at the market price.

</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>In Panel A, the demand curve facing a monopolist is the market demand curve. In Panel B, a perfectly competitive firm takes the market price as given, so the firm-specific demand curve is horizontal. The firm can sell all it wants at the market price, but would sell nothing if it charged a higher price.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="monopoly"><strong>Monopoly</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>A single firm serves the entire market. A monopoly occurs when the barriers to market entry are very large. This can result from very large <a href="ch-8.html#economies-of-scale">economies of scale</a> or a government policy that limits the number of firms. Some examples of monopolies that result from large economies of scale are local phone service, cable TV, and electric power transmission. Some examples of monopolies established by government policy are drugs covered by patents, the selling of firewood in national parks, and the U.S. Postal Service.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="monopolistic-competition"><strong>Monopolistic competition</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>There are no barriers to entering the market, so there are many firms, and each firm sells a slightly different product. For example, coffee shops in your city provide slightly different goods and compete for customers. Your local grocery store sells many brands of toothbrushes, with slight differences in size, shape, color, and style.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="oligopoly"><strong>Oligopoly</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The market consists of just a few firms because <a href="ch-8.html#economies-of-scale">economies of scale</a> or government policies limit the number of firms. Some product examples are automobiles, computer processor chips, airline travel, and breakfast cereals. The large economies of scale in automobile production result from the large startup costs, with billions of dollars required to build a factory or assembly plant. Similarly, a fabrication plant for computer processor chips costs several billion dollars.</li>

<h3 id="the-total-approach-computing-total-revenue-and-total-cost">9.2.1 The Total Approach: Computing Total Revenue and Total Cost</h3>

</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Economic profit is shown by the vertical distance between the total-revenue curve and the total-cost curve. To maximize profit, the firm chooses the quantity of output that generates the largest vertical difference between the two curves.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-marginal-approach">9.2.2 The Marginal Approach</h3>
<p>The other way for a firm to decide how much output to produce relies on the <a href="ch-2.html#the-marginal-principle">marginal principle</a>, the general decision-making rule that is one of the key principles of economics.</p>
<p><a name="marginal-revenue"><strong>Marginal revenue</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The change in total revenue from selling one more unit of output.</li>
</ul>
<p>A perfectly competitive firm takes the market price as given, so the marginal revenue–the change in total revenue from one more shirt–is simply the price:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{marginal revenue} = \text{price}
\]</span></p>
<p>The marginal principle tells us that the firm will maximize its profit by choosing the quantity at which price equals marginal cost:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{To maximize profit, produce the quantity where price} = \text{marginal
cost}
\]</span></p>
<figure>
<img src="../../../../files/spring-2020/ECON-121/ch-9/ch-9_figure-9.3.png" alt="Figure 9.3 The Marginal Approach to Picking an Output Level" /><figcaption>Figure 9.3 The Marginal Approach to Picking an Output Level</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>A perfectly competitive firm takes the market price as given, so the marginal benefit, or marginal revenue, equals the price. Using the marginal principle, the typical firm will maximize profit at point <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, where the $12 market price equals the marginal cost. Economic profit equals the difference between the price and the average cost ($4.125=$12−$7.875) times the quantity produced (eight shirts per minute), or $33 per minute.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="economic-profit-and-the-break-even-price">9.2.3 Economic Profit and the Break-Even Price</h3>
<p>We’ve seen that the perfectly competitive firm maximizes its profit by producing the quantity at which its marginal revenue (price) equals its marginal cost. How much profit does the firm earn? The firm’s economic profit equals its total revenue minus its total cost. One way to compute a firm’s total economic profit is to multiply the average profit per unit produced–the gap between the price and the average cost–by the quantity produced:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{economic profit} = (\text{price} - \text{average cost}) \times
\text{quantity produced}
\]</span></p>
<p>How would a decrease in price affect the firm’s output decision? A decrease in price shifts the marginal-revenue (price) line downward, so it will intersect the marginal-cost curve at a smaller quantity.</p>
<p>This is the <a href="ch-4.html#law-of-supply">law of supply</a> in action: The lower the price, the smaller the quantity supplied.</p>
<p><a name="break-even-price"><strong>Break-even price</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The price at which economic profit is zero; price equals average total cost.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-firms-shut-down-decision">9.3 The Firm’s Shut-Down Decision</h2>
<p>Consider next the decisions faced by a firm that is losing money. Suppose the price of shirts drops to $4, which is so low that the firm’s total revenue is less than its total cost. In Table 9.3, the marginal principle tells the firm to produce four shirts at this price, but the firm’s total cost of $30 exceeds its total revenue of $16, so the firm will lose $14 per minute. Should the firm continue to operate at a loss or shut down?</p>

<p>The decision to operate or shut down is a short-run decision, a day-to-day decision to temporarily halt production in response to market conditions. Suppose our shirt factory hires workers by the day, so it makes the decision at the beginning of each day. The decision-making rule is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{operate if total revenue} &gt; \text{variable cost} \\
\text{shut down if total revenue} &lt; \text{variable cost}
\]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the price is $4, marginal revenue equals marginal cost at four shirts (point <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>). At this quantity, average cost is $7.50, so the firm loses $3.50 on each shirt, for a total loss of $14. Total revenue is $16 and the variable cost is only $13, so the firm is better off operating at a loss rather than shutting down and losing its fixed cost of $17. The shut-down price, shown by the minimum point of the <em>AVC</em> curve, is $3.00.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-shut-down-price">9.3.2 The Shut-Down Price</h3>
<p>There is a shortcut for determining whether it is sensible to continue to operate: compare the price to the average variable cost. Total revenue equals the price times the quantity produced, and the variable cost equals the average variable cost times the quantity produced. Therefore, total revenue will exceed variable cost if the price exceeds the average variable cost. If that happens, the firm should continue to operate. Otherwise, the firm should shut down.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{operate if price} &gt; \text{average variable cost} \\
\text{shut down if price} &lt; \text{average variable cost}
\]</span></p>
<p>In Figure 9.4, with a price of $4, the marginal principle is satisfied at point a, and the average variable cost of producing four shirts is $3.25 (point <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>). The price exceeds the average variable cost, so it is sensible to continue operating, even at a loss.</p>
<p><a name="shut-down-price"><strong>Shut-down price</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The price at which the firm is indifferent between operating and shutting down; equal to the minimum average variable cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find the shut-down price, we find the minimum point on the AVC curve. In Figure 9.4, AVC reaches its minimum of $3 at a quantity of three shirts per minute, so the shut-down price is $3 (shown by point d). The average variable cost never drops below $3, so if the price drops below $3 it would be impossible to generate enough revenue to cover the firm’s variable cost. When the price equals the shut-down price, the firm is generating just enough revenue to cover its variable costs, so it is just as well off operating as shutting down.</p>

<p>In Panel A, the firm’s short-run supply curve is the part of the marginal-cost curve above the shut-down price. In Panel B, there are 100 firms in the market, so the market supply at a given price is 100 times the quantity supplied by the typical firm.

<p>Panel B of Figure 9.5 shows the short-run market supply curve when there are 100 identical shirt firms. For each price, we get the quantity supplied for the entire market by multiplying the quantity supplied by the typical firm (from the individual supply curve) by 100. At a price of $7, each firm produces six shirts (point <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in Panel A), so the market supply is 600 shirts (point <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in Panel B). If the price increases to $12, each firm increases production to eight shirts (point <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> in Panel A), so the market supply is 800 shirts (point <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> in Panel B).</p>

<p>Figure 9.6 shows a perfectly competitive market in equilibrium. For a short-run equilibrium, two conditions are satisfied:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>At the market level, the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity demanded. The demand curve intersects the short-run market supply curve at a price of $7 and a quantity of 600 shirts per minute (Panel A).</li>
<li>The typical firm in the market maximizes its profit, given the market price. At a market price of $7, each of the 100 firms maximizes profit by producing six shirts per minute (Panel B).</li>

<p>In Panel A, the market demand curve intersects the short-run market supply curve at a price of $7. In Panel B, given the market price of $7, the typical firm satisfies the marginal principle at point <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, producing six shirts per minute. The $7 price equals the average cost at the equilibrium quantity, so economic profit is zero, and no other firms will enter the market.</p>

<ul>
<li>An industry in which the average cost of production increases as the total output of the industry increases; the long-run supply curve is positively sloped.</li>
</ul>
<p>Average cost of production increases as the total output increases, for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Increasing input price</strong>. As an industry grows, it competes with other industries for limited amounts of various inputs, and this competition drives up the prices of these inputs. For example, suppose the shirt industry competes against other industries for a limited amount of cotton. To get more cotton to produce more shirts, firms in the shirt industry must outbid other industries for the limited amount available, and this drives up the price of cotton.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Less productive inputs</strong>. A small industry will use only the most productive inputs, but as the industry grows, firms may be forced to use less productive inputs. For example, a small shirt industry will use only the most skillful workers, but as the industry grows, it will hire workers with lower skills. As the average skill level of the industry’s workforce decreases, the average cost of production increases: A firm will require more labor time–and pay more in labor costs–to produce each shirt.</p></li>

<p>The long-run supply curve tells us how much output will be produced at each price in the long run, when the number of firms in the market can change.</p>

</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>The long-run market supply curve shows the relationship between the price and quantity supplied in the long run, when firms can enter or leave the industry. At each point on the supply curve, the market price equals the long-run average cost of production. Because this is an increasing-cost industry, the long-run market supply curve is positively sloped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The long-run supply curve in Figure 9.7 is positively sloped, as it will be for any increasing-cost industry. This is another example of the law of supply. An increase in the price of shirts initially makes shirt production profitable, so firms enter the market and produce more shirts. As industry-wide output increases, the greater demand for cotton and labor increases input prices, which in turn increases the average cost of producing shirts. Firms will continue to enter the market until the average cost rises to the point where it equals the price of shirts. The positively sloped supply curve tells us the market won’t produce a larger quantity of shirts unless the price rises to cover the higher average cost associated with the larger industry.</p>

But in the long run, firms can enter the industry and build more production facilities, so the price eventually drops to $10 (point <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>).

<h3 id="hurricane-andrew-and-the-price-of-ice">9.7.2 Hurricane Andrew and the Price of Ice</h3>
<p>For an example of the effects of an increase in demand in a constant-cost industry, let’s look at the short-run and long-run effects of a hurricane. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew struck the southeastern United States, leaving millions of people without electricity for several days. Figure 9.11 shows the short-run and long-run effects of the hurricane on the price of ice, which was used to cool and preserve food in areas without electricity. Before the hurricane, the market was at point a, with a price of $1 per bag of ice. The long-run supply curve is horizontal, indicating that the ice industry is a constant-cost industry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A hurricane increases the demand for ice, shifting the demand curve to the right. In the short run, the supply curve is relatively steep, so the price rises by a large amount–from $1 to $5. In the long run, firms enter the industry, pulling the price back down. Because ice production is a constant-cost industry, the supply is horizontal, and the large upward jump in price is followed by a downward slide back to the original price.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we explored the decisions made by perfectly competitive firms and the implications of these decisions for the supply side of the market. In the short run, a firm uses the marginal principle to decide how much output to produce. In the long run, a firm will enter a market if the price exceeds the average cost of production. Here are the main points of this chapter:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A <em>price-taking</em> firm should produce the quantity of output at which the marginal revenue (the price) equals the marginal cost of production.</li>
<li>An unprofitable firm should continue to operate if its total revenue exceeds its total variable cost.</li>
<li>The long-run supply curve will be positively sloped if the average cost of production increases as the industry grows.</li>
<li>The long-run supply curve is flatter than the short-run supply curve because there are diminishing returns in the short run, but not in the long run.</li>
<li>An increase in demand causes a large upward jump in price, followed by a downward slide to the new long-run equilibrium price.</li>
