<h3 id="economic-view-of-traffic-congestion">1.2.1 Economic View of Traffic Congestion</h3>
<pre>
Consider first the problem of traffic congestion. According to the Texas
Transportation Institute, the typical U.S. commuter wastes about 42 hours per
year because of traffic congestion.1 In some cities, the time wasted is much
greater: 82 hours in Washington, D.C., 80 hours in Los Angeles, 78 hours in San
Francisco, and 74 hours in New York. In addition to time lost, we also waste 3
billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel each year.

To an economist, the diagnosis of the congestion problem is straightforward.
When you drive onto a busy highway during rush hour, your car takes up space and
decreases the distance between the vehicles on the highway. A driver's normal
reaction to a shorter distance between moving cars is to slow down. So, when you
enter the highway, you force other commuters to slow down and thus spend more
time on the highway. If each of your 900 fellow commuters spends just two extra
seconds on the highway, you will increase the total travel time by 30 minutes.
In deciding whether to use the highway, you will presumably ignore these costs
you impose on others. Similarly, your fellow commuters ignore the cost they
impose on you and others when they enter the highway. Because no single commuter
pays the full cost (30 minutes), too many people use the highway, and everyone
wastes time.

One possible solution to the congestion problem is to force people to pay for
using the road, just as they pay for gasoline and tires. The government could
impose a congestion tax of $8 per trip on rush-hour commuters and use a debit
card system to collect the tax: Every time a car passes a checkpoint, a
transponder would charge the commuter's card. Traffic volume during rush hours
would then decrease as travelers (a) shift their travel to off-peak times, (b)
switch to ride-sharing and mass transit, and (c) shift their travel to less
congested routes. The job for the economist is to compute the appropriate
congestion tax and predict the consequences of imposing it.

<h3 id="trade-offs-from-international-trade">1.2.2 Trade-offs from International Trade</h3>
<pre>
Most nations are not self-sufficient, but instead specialize in producing
some products and import other products from their trading partners. For
example, Canada's climate is suitable for growing fir trees and producing
plywood panels, while Mexico's climate is suitable for growing lemon trees
and producing lemons.  If Canada specializes in plywood panels and Mexico
specializes in lemons, there are more panels and lemons available to
consume, and each country can consume more of both products.

There are trade-offs associated with changes in trade patterns. Suppose
Canada initially grows all the lemons it consumes in heated greenhouses,
while Mexico initially grows fir trees in air-conditioned greenhouses. The
policy makers recognize the inherent inefficiency of using greenhouses
rather than outdoor growing, and promote trade in lemons from Mexico and
plywood panels from Canada.  As we'll see later in the book, there are
trade-offs associated with specialization and trade.

1. Lower prices for lemons and plywood panels: It is less costly to grow
  lemons and trees outdoors, so the price of lemons in Canada will
  decrease, and so will the price of plywood panels in Mexico.

2. Canada jobs: Wood employment increases, while lemon employment decreases.

3. Mexico jobs: Lemon employment increases, while plywood panel employment
  decreases.

4. Greenhouse jobs: In both countries, there will be fewer jobs in
  greenhouse fabrication.

To illustrate the trade-offs from an increase in trade, let's take the
Canadian perspective. Consumers are winners, as they pay a lower price for
lemons. Wood workers are winners, too, as the demand for their services
increases, boosting their wages. In contrast, workers who initially grew
lemons or built greenhouses are losers in the short run: the demand for
their services decreases, resulting in job losses or lower wages. Of course,
trade increases the number of wood jobs in Canada, and if lemon and
greenhouse workers could be instantly converted into wood workers, the
negative employment consequences would be short lived. But workers are not
interchangeable parts that can be instantly reallocated to wood production,
so the adjustment to the new labor environment takes time. As a result,
workers who are displaced by lemon imports will experience low wages and
fewer job opportunities, and the negative consequences will persist until
they make the transition into new jobs in the wood industry.

As we'll see later in the book, the adjustment costs associated with changes
in trade patterns present challenges for policy makers. In the United
States, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program (TAA) assists displaced
workers in their search for new jobs. The TAA provides job training,
relocation allowances, job information, and other assistance. The deployment
of TAA can reduce the negative employment effects of an increase in
international trade.

<h3 id="economic-view-of-managing-the-u.s.-economy">1.2.3 Economic View of Managing the U.S. Economy</h3>
<pre>
The United States and the rest of the world have now recovered from the
financial crisis that gripped the world in 2007. If all goes well, the world
economy will resume a normal rate of economic growth and living standards
will rise throughout the world. Economists and policy makers shifted their
focus to the potential overheating of economies and the possibility of
inflation (rising prices).

In combating the <b>global recession triggered by the financial crisis of
2007</b> governments throughout the world <b>made it much easier for firms and
households to borrow money for investment and consumer goods. Governments
used clever financial policies to drop interest rates to historic lows,</b>
and firms and households responded by increasing their spending. <b>Now that
economies throughout the world have recovered, economists and policy makers
are concerned that firms and households may borrow and spend too much,
resulting in overheated economies and rising prices.</b>

In the United States, new tax and spending policies adopted in 2018 pose the
same risk of overheating and inflation. The U.S. government cut taxes on
businesses to encourage investment spending and relaxed spending
constraints. In combination, these tax and spending policies have the
potential to increase the demand for goods and services by an amount
sufficient to overheat the economy.  Over the next few years, <b>the
objective of policy makers is to adjust taxes, spending, and financial
policies to keep the economy growing without causing inflation.</b>

<p>%% ## 1.3 The Economic Way of Thinking</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There are 4 Elements of the economic way of thinking…</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="use-assumptions-to-simplify">1.3.1 Use Assumptions to Simplify</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simplifying analysis may result to an unrealistic assumptions.</li>
<li>Although some analyses are based on unrealistic assumptions, that doesn’t mean that your analyses are invalid/faulty.</li>
<li>The lesson is that we must think carefully about whether a simplifying assumption is truly harmless.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="isolate-variablesceteris-paribus">1.3.2 Isolate Variables–<em>Ceteris Paribus</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ceteris paribus</em> is a latin expression meaning that other variables are held fix</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Economic analysis often involves variables and how they affect one another.
<ul>
<li>A <em>variable</em> is a measure of something that can take on different values.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Economists are interested in exploring relationships between two variables.</li>
<li>They isolate a variable apart from others that are effectively changing the value of the outcome to see the relationship between the variable from each other.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="think-at-the-margin">1.3.3 Think at the Margin</h3>
<p><strong>Marginal change</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A small, one-unit change in value.</li>
<li>For example, you might ask, “If I study just one more hour, by how much will my exam score increase?” Economists call this process “thinking at the margin.” Thinking at the margin is like thinking on the edge.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rational-people-respond-to-incentives">1.3.4 Rational People Respond to Incentives</h3>
<ul>
<li>A key assumption of most economic analysis is that people act rationally, meaning they act in their own self-interest.</li>
<li>Rational people respond to incentives. When the payoff, or benefit, from doing something changes, people change their behavior to get the benefit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-southern-california-addresses-its-congestion-problem">1.3.5 Example: Southern California Addresses Its Congestion Problem</h3>
<p>To illustrate the economic way of thinking, let’s consider again how an economist would approach the problem of traffic congestion. Recall that each driver on the highway slows down other drivers but ignores these time costs when deciding whether to use the highway. If the government imposes a congestion tax to reduce traffic during rush hour, the economist is faced with a question: How high should the tax be?</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate congestion tax, an economist would assume that people respond to incentives and use the three other elements of the economic way of thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use assumptions to simplify.</strong> To simplify the problem, we would assume that every car has the same effect on the travel time of other cars. Of course, this is unrealistic because people drive cars of different sizes in different ways. But the alternative–looking at the effects of each car on travel speeds–would needlessly complicate the analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolate variables–use <em>ceteris paribus</em>.</strong> To focus attention on the effects of a congestion tax on the number of cars using the highway, we would make the <em>ceteris paribus</em> assumption that everything else that affects travel behavior–the price of gasoline, bus fares, and consumer income–remains fixed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Think at the margin.</strong> To think at the margin, we would estimate the effects of adding one more car to the highway. Now consider the marginal question: If we add one more car to the highway, by how much does the total travel time for commuters increase? Once we answer this question, we can determine the cost imposed by the marginal driver. If the marginal driver forces each of the 900 commuters to spend two extra seconds on the highway, total travel time increases by 30 minutes. If the value of time is, say, $16 per hour, the appropriate congestion tax would be $8 (equal to $16 x 1/2 hour).</p></li>
</ul>
