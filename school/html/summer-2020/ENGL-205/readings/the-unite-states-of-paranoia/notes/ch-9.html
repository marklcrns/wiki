<h1 id="chapter-9-operation-mindfuck">Chapter 9: Operation Mindfuck</h1>
<p>“In 1969, The East Village Other was the trippiest paper in New York: a kaleidoscopic combination of absurdist headlines and psychedelic graphics that made The Village Voice look as stuffy as The New York Times. The actual articles could be pretty freaky too: outré stuff about LSD and UFOs, sex and revolution. And conspiracies.” (p. 219).</p>
<p>“A certain class of reader values bizarre and paranoid theories precisely because they are bizarre and paranoid”, Thomas M. Disch (p. 221).</p>
<p>“In the ironic style, the most interesting thing about a conspiracy theory isn’t that it might or might not be true; it’s that it constructs a story out of the everyday truths we only hazily perceive.” (p. 221).</p>
<p>“Keel’s book mentions that”a few of the ego-tripping characters in ufology" were prone to “placing prank calls,” but the author seems oblivious to the fact that Barker was one of them:" (p. 225).</p>
<p>“Krassner had simply assumed that everyone would be able to tell the satiric from the sincere. When it turned out that many readers found that difficult, he didn’t look for ways to clear up the confusion; he looked for ways to have fun with it” (pp. 227-228)</p>
<p>“When LBJ had been competing with Kennedy for the 1960 presidential nomination, he had called his rival’s father a Nazi sympathizer. The article went on to describe the president’s infidelities, which were well known in journalistic circles but had not yet been reported, and then it grew steadily less reliable, concluding with a scene of Lyndon Baines sticking his Johnson in the president’s throat wound. It is a testament to Krassner’s literary skill- or the average reader’s gullibility, or LBJ’s unpopularity- that many people were fooled.” (p. 228).</p>
<p>“1960s… the Report from Iron Mountain on the Possibility and Desirability of Peace… a conclave tasked with considering what Washington should do if a”general condition of peace" should break out. War is a social stabilizer, the purported panel concluded. It allows planners to judiciously burn off excess economic inventory, it channels “antisocial elements” into “an acceptable role,” it establishes “the basic authority of a modern state over its people,” and it helps “preserve whatever quality and degree of poverty a society requires as an incentive.”" (p. 229).</p>
<p>“‘Peace Scare Drives Market Down.’… The book’s primary author, Leonard Lewin, confessed to the hoax in 1972, but that didn’t stop people from believing the Report was real.” (p. 230).</p>
<p>“People still tout the Report as a genuine window into the mind of the Enemy Above. Some of them don’t seem to be aware of Lewin’s confession; others know about it but just don’t believe it.”The government claimed it was a HOAX," wrote Stewart Best" (p. 230).</p>
<p>“The only problem with all of this is the simple fact that IT WAS PUBLISHED AS NON-FICTION, and it was claimed at the time of the release that it was AUTHENTIC by both Lewen [sic] and the Editor-in-Chief of Dial Press.” 32 You might get the impression that Best does not comprehend how a hoax works." (pp. 230-231) Edition.</p>
<p>“The purpose of The Discordian Society is to provide false, comforting answers to questions of this sort; to give mystical reasons for the disorder around us; to promote unworkable principles of discord- in short, to provide the world with a workshop for the insane, thus keeping them out of mischief as Presidents, Ambassadors, Priests, Ministers, and other Dictators.” (p. 233).</p>
<p>“Discordians, they decided, were discouraged from praying, prohibited from eating hot dog buns, and encouraged to break the prohibition on eating hot dog buns. And every Discordian was a pope. Or at least all the male Discordians were. The women were called momes.” (p. 233).</p>
<p>“Order, the Discordians argued, is in the eye of the beholder.”The real reality is there," the Principia explained, “but everything you KNOW about ‘it’ is in your mind and yours to do with as you like. Conceptualization is art, and YOU ARE THE ARTIST.”" (p. 233).</p>
<p>“Wilson’s writing was marked both by skepticism and by a playful willingness to suspend his skepticism. He believed conspiracies were”standard mammalian politics," but he also recognized, as in his comments about Webster, that conspiracy theories often revealed more about the theorist than they did about the actual objects of the theorizing." (p. 234).</p>
<p>“Many of them congratulated me on the number of my predictions that came true, although actually none of them ever came true.” Wilson (p. 238).</p>
<p>“Operation Mindfuck, a free-form art project that was part political protest, part parade of pranks.” (p. 239).</p>
<p>%% use this “that Wilson, himself, was an Illuminati agent attempting to lampoon and discredit conspiracy theories.” Others, on the other hand, “felt sure he was doing his best to slip the truth past Establishment censors by disguising the truth as a titillating parody.” (p. 244).</p>
<p>“McAlpine didn’t share Wilson’s sense of the absurd, but he did agree about the importance of exploring multiple perspectives.” (p. 245).</p>
<p>“Drummond had told Stang as they were inventing the faith.”Let’s just call it The Conspiracy." This wouldn’t be just any old cabal. “It’s not just the people who shot JFK or the crashed flying saucer in Area 51 or Roswell,” Stang later explained. “It’s everybody. Every normal person is out to get every abnormal person. Just instinctively.” (pp. 250-251)</p>
