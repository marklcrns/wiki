<p>Andrew Jackson - January 30, 1835</p>
<ul>
<li>Failed assassination by Richard Lawrence (aka King Richard III).</li>
<li>Pistol misfired, second weapon failed too.</li>
<li>Assumed that Poindexter hired Lawrence to assassinate him.</li>
<li>Some of Jackson’s critics suggest that he had staged the assault to gain public support, which explained why both weapons failed.</li>
</ul>
<p>George Poindexter</p>
<ul>
<li>Noisy opponent of Jackson administration</li>
<li>Claiming to have seen with Richard Lawrence before the assassination of Jackson.</li>
<li>Accused of plotting the assignation of president Jackson.</li>
</ul>
<p>John Calhoun</p>
<ul>
<li>South Carolina senator and former vice president</li>
<li>Some Jacksonian pointed fingers at Calhoun, he argues if “he had not been directly involved in the assassination attempt, he had at the very least incited it with a speech denouncing Jackson as an American Caesar” (p. 4).</li>
</ul>
<p>John Smith Dye</p>
<ul>
<li>Described the Jacksonian assassination 29 years later.</li>
<li>Thought Calhoun was involved in to a larger force, Slave Power,that would have benefited if Jackson died.</li>
<li>Reported Slave Power was more than willing to kill a powerful man to get its way.</li>
<li>“President William Henry Harrison told Calhoun he wasn’t sure he was willing to annex Texas, which southerners wanted to add to the union as a slave state. <strong>Harrison promptly died</strong>.” (p. 4). Dye was sure the cause of death was arsenic instead of the reported pneumonia.</li>
<li>“President Zachary Taylor opposed the Slave Power’s agenda in Cuba and the Southwest, and so he was killed by the same poison.” (p. 4).</li>
<li>“President-elect James Buchanan prepared to make some appointments of which the slaveocrats disapproved, Dye declared, he narrowly survived one of the most elaborate assassination plots ever conceived.” (pp. 4-5).</li>
<li>“On February 23, 1857, according to Dye, southern agents poisoned all the bowls containing lump sugar at the National Hotel in Washington, D.C. Southerners, he explained, drink coffee; coffee drinkers use pulverized sugar; so the southern diners would be spared and the tea-drinking northern diners, including Buchanan, would be wiped out.” (p. 5).</li>
<li>“Buchanan ‘became more than ever the tool of the slave power.’” (p. 5).</li>
<li>His theories has little evidence. Some were debunked years later autopsy.</li>
<li>Wrote <em>The Adder’s Den</em> and was published in 1864. New edition appeared 2 years later, <em>History of the Plots and Crimse of the Great Conspiracy to Overthrow Liberty in America</em></li>
<li>Drew his theories on floating through Whig and Republican circles for years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Letter to Lincoln. “I have often heard it stated by Physicians, that it was an undoubted fact, that our two last Whig Presidents, Gen’s Harrison &amp; Taylor, came to their sudden and lamentable ends, by subtle poisons, administered in their food at the White House.” (p. 6).</p>
<p>“we had a return of that bad water, and two or three Senators—Republicans, mind you—are prostrated with sudden illness. What does it mean? Why does it happen that whenever the current sets against the Master Demon of Slavery (and never at any other time), we find the air, and the water, and the whisky of Washington full of poison?” (p. 7).</p>
<ul>
<li>“Planter elites” (p. 7).</li>
</ul>
<p>Slave Power alleged agenda to make “slavery universal and perpetual”, Lincoln (p. 7).</p>
<p>“It was a paranoid time. In America, it is always a paranoid time.” (p. 8).</p>
<p>“Pundits tend to write off political paranoia as a feature of the fringe, a disorder that occasionally flares up until the sober center can put out the flames. They’re wrong. The fear of conspiracies has been a potent force across the political spectrum, from the colonial era to the present, in the establishment as well as at the extremes. Conspiracy theories played major roles in conflicts from the Indian wars of the seventeenth century to the labor battles of the Gilded Age, from the Civil War to the Cold War, from the American Revolution to the War on Terror.” (p. 8).</p>
<ul>
<li>“Paranoid Style in American Politics”, Richard Hofstadter (p. 8).</li>
<li>9/11 and JFK’s assassination polled to be likely be plotted by U.S. leaders (p. 8).</li>
<li>Stanley Cohen “moral panic.” “A time were fear and hysteria are magnified distorted…” (p. 10).</li>
<li>An essential feature of a moral panic is a folk devil, a figure the sociologist Erich Goode has defined as “an evil agent responsible for the threatening condition”29—typically a scapegoat who is not, in fact, responsible for the threat. (p. 11).</li>
<li>that the syndicate amounted to an “invisible government,” a “hidden hand,” and a “secret power,k and that”behind our city and state governments there is an unseen power which controls them." (p. 11).</li>
<li>Coerced prostitution led to the creation of Federal Bureau of Investigation ,FBI (p. 11).</li>
<li>“How shall we maintain our honored form of government, or protect life and property from assassination at the hands of these conspirators, if their dark and damning deeds are allowed to continue and be perfected?” (p. 12)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>This enemy seems to be on many counts a projection of the self: both the ideal
and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him. A fundamental
paradox of the paranoid style is the imitation of the enemy. The enemy, for
example, may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him
in the apparatus of scholarship, even of pedantry... Secret organizations set up
to combat secret organizations give the same flattery. The Ku Klux Klan imitated
Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an elaborate
ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy. The John Birch Society emulates
Communist cells and quasi-secret operation through &quot;front&quot; groups, and preaches
a ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar to those
it finds in the Communist enemy. Spokesmen of the various Christian
anti-Communist &quot;crusades&quot; openly express their admiration for the dedication,
discipline, and strategic ingenuity the Communist cause calls forth. (p. 13).</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>This dread had been building throughout the Kennedy years and exploded after the president’s assassination, which many people either blamed directly on the far Right or attributed to an atmosphere of fear and division fed by right-wing rhetoric. (p. 13).</p></li>
<li>When scholars and pundits aren’t claiming that paranoia is limited to the political extremes, they sometimes claim that it’s a product of particularly harsh times (p. 14).</li>
<li>“Conspiracy theories,” Frum wrote, “always flourish during economic downturns.” (p. 14).</li>
<li>For the last few decades, elements of whatever party is out of power have worried that the party in power would turn fascist (p. 15)</li>
<li>United States is riven by conflicts. But there is also the possibility that peace breeds nightmares just as surely as strife does. (p. 15).</li>
<li><p>“it’s the most peaceful societies which are also the most haunted, in their imaginative constructions of the cosmos, by constant specters of perennial war.” (p. 15)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a book about America’s demons. Many of those demons are imaginary, but all of them have truths to tell us. A conspiracy story that catches on becomes a form of folklore. It says something true about the anxieties and experiences of the people who believe and repeat it, even if it says nothing true about the objects of the theory itself. (pp. 15-16).</p>
<p>Just as an animist treats natural forces as conscious spirits, many conspiracists treat social forces as conscious cabals. (p. 16)</p>
<p>Take the idea that the football star O.J. Simpson was framed for the murder of his wife. Simpson was probably guilty, but sometimes the police do frame suspects, and few would claim that innocent black men never run into trouble with racist cops. (p. 16).</p>
<p><em>Myths</em> are “…culturally resonant ideas that appear again and again when Americans communicate with one another: archetypes that can absorb all kinds of allegations, true or not, and arrange them into a familiar form.” (p. 16).</p>
<p>“One is the Enemy Outside, who plots outside the community’s gates, and one is the Enemy Within, comprising villainous neighbors who can’t easily be distinguished from friends. There is the Enemy Above, hiding at the top of the social pyramid, and there is the Enemy Below, lurking at the bottom. <strong>And then there is the Benevolent Conspiracy, which isn’t an enemy at all: a secret force working behind the scenes to improve people’s lives.</strong>” (p. 16)</p>
<p>“Different people adopt and adapt these myths for their own needs, keeping the scaffolding of a story line in place while changing the content.” (p. 17).</p>
<p>“Conspiracy tales can change even more dramatically when a story leaks from one social group to another. Different people adopt and adapt these myths for their own needs, keeping the scaffolding of a story line in place while changing the content.” (p. 17).</p>
<p><strong>Taking fictions at face value</strong> (p. 20)</p>
<p>Vocabs</p>
<ul>
<li>fringe = outsider</li>
<li>dissidents = person opposing an official policy</li>
<li>demagogues = political leader who seeks support by appealing to the desires and prejudices of ordinary people rather than by using rational argument.</li>
