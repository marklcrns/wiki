<h1 id="chapter-12-everything-is-a-clue">Chapter 12: Everything is a Clue</h1>
<p>“October 7, 2001: less than a month after 9/ 11. Police in Maryland decide that two trucks on Interstate 270 might be carrying explosives. The alert cops block traffic for an hour, searching the vehicles for tools of terror. The cargo turns out to be stage equipment headed to a memorial service for the firefighters killed in the attack. A forgivable mistake, given the circumstances? Perhaps.” (p. 299).</p>
<p>“It was the same species of fear that had flared during earlier hunts for spies and saboteurs. But now the consequences of failing to spot the conspirators seemed much more catastrophic. Anything might be a weapon; anything might be a clue.” (p. 300).</p>
<p>“In January 2007, guerrilla marketers erected illuminated signs in locations around ten cities, each displaying one of the Mooninite characters from the Aqua Teen Hunger Force TV cartoon. In nine of those cities, the campaign went off without incident, but in Boston the cops construed the signs as bombs and essentially locked down the town. On learning that the installations were not explosives, officials started calling them a”hoax," as though the advertisers had expected people to mistake the Mooninites for weapons. “It had a very sinister appearance,” Massachusetts attorney general Martha Coakley said of one of the signs. “It had a battery behind it, and wires.”" (p. 302).</p>
<p>“When people enter an apocalyptic frame of mind, the historian Richard Landes has observed,”everything quickens, enlightens, coheres. They become semiotically aroused- everything has meaning, patterns."" (p. 302).</p>
<p>“One frequently forwarded e-mail gave readers instructions on how to fold a $ 20 bill, revealing an image that seemed to predict the planes hitting the towers:” (p. 302).</p>
<p>“The sociologists who study disasters are wary about using the word panic. In real-world disasters, as we noted in chapter 3, genuine panic is rare and spontaneous social cooperation is the norm. But in 2008, the Rutgers sociologists Lee Clarke and Caron Chess suggested that events like Katrina can spark something they called an elite panic. When the hurricane hit New Orleans, there were rumors that dozens of dead bodies were stacked in the convention center where refugees had taken shelter, that men were firing weapons at the helicopters coming to rescue them, that roving bands of rapists were assaulting people willy-nilly, that survivors of the storm had turned to cannibalism. 19”Misinformed about conditions on the ground and overly fearful of the loss of property," Clarke and Chess wrote, “officials turned resources away from rescue in New Orleans. Elites responding after Katrina were disconnected from non-elites and obviously fearful of them. Further, their actions and inactions created greater danger for others.”" (pp. 306-307).</p>
<p>“The first decade of the twenty-first century saw three particularly notable eruptions of elite paranoia. The first came with the reactions to the 9/ 11 attacks. The second was the response to Katrina, when powerful people’s fears both fed and were reinforced by the centralization and militarization of disaster relief. And the third began when Barack Obama became president, as commentators treated a group of unconnected crimes as a grand, malevolent movement.” (p. 307).</p>
<p>“As is often the case with paranoid perspectives, this connect-the-dots fantasy said more about the tellers’ anxieties than it did about any order actually emerging in the world.” (p. 307).</p>
<p>“On June 10, 2009, an elderly man entered the Holocaust museum, raised a rifle, and opened fire, killing a security guard named Stephen Tyrone Johns. Two other guards shot back, wounding the gunman before he could kill anyone else. The killer was soon identified as James Wenneker von Brunn, an eighty-eight-year-old neo-Nazi. Von Brunn acted alone, but there was no shortage of voices eager to spread the blame for his crime. Pundits quickly linked the murder, in a free-associative way, to the assassination ten days earlier of the Kansas abortionist George Tiller. This, we were told, was a “pattern” of “rising right-wing violence.”" (pp. 307-308).</p>
<p>“Crime wave thus established, the analysts moved on to denounce the unindicted instigators. Those weren’t just killers, the narrative went; they were killers inflamed by demagogues.” (p. 308).</p>
<p>“The charitable reading of this passage is that it’s a sloppily phrased attempt to list the ideas that drive various right-wing extremists, not a declaration that anyone opposed to abortion or prone to”rejecting federal authority" is a threat. 27 But even under that interpretation, the report is inexcusably vague. It focuses on extremism itself, not on violence, and there’s no reason to believe that its definition of “extremist” is limited to people with violent inclinations." (p. 309).</p>
<p>“Threat reports that focus on ideology instead of criminal activity are threatening to civil liberties and a wholly ineffective use of federal security resources.”" (p. 309).</p>
<p>“And in the press, the new Brown Scare continued to flourish, as incidents were uncritically presented as evidence that political rhetoric was inciting political violence.” (p. 310).</p>
<p>“I asked Malcolm Wiley, a Secret Service spokesman, about the claim. He wouldn’t give out the correct figures, but he denied that Kessler’s number was correct. According to Wiley, there was a period while Obama was still a candidate when he had received more threats than the sitting president.”But since he became president, that has leveled off," he continued. “The number of threats he has received has been consistent with the number received by Bush, Clinton, Reagan, and others.”" (p. 311).</p>
<p>“In the absence of more detailed data, it isn’t obvious what factors fueled the increase. But when someone decides to assault an IRS employee, one government official told me, it’s”usually a personal event that’s a catalyst."" (p. 312).</p>
<p>“Krugman declared that”toxic rhetoric" was the force compelling them to act out." (p. 312).</p>
<p>“The biggest problem with the SPLC list is that it lumps together a very varied set of organizations, blurring the boundary between people who might have sympathy for aggressive violence and people who would want no part of it. “Generally,” the center explains, the groups on its Patriot roster “define themselves as opposed to the ‘New World Order,’ engage in groundless conspiracy theorizing, or advocate or adhere to extreme antigovernment doctrines.” 42 That covers a lot of ground. Using such a list to track the threat of right-wing terrorism is like tracking the threat of jihadist terrorism by counting the country’s mosques." (p. 313).</p>
<p>“Perliger’s data did indeed show such an increase, though he also included an important caveat. The”quality of, and accessibility to, data on hate crimes and far right violence has improved during the last two decades," he noted, so “we need to take this into consideration when interpreting findings relating to fluctuations in levels of violence.”" (p. 315).</p>
<p>“In 2009 and 2010- the period when the”rising right-wing violence" narrative was ubiquitous in the media- the number of violent right-wing incidents was actually declining. Let me repeat that: As pundits were issuing frantic warnings about the great beast stirring in the fever swamps, the number of attacks was going down." (p. 316).</p>
<p>“Some Tea Partiers were prone to conspiracy theories of their own, from the claim that Obama’s health care bill would establish”death panels" to the familiar charge that FEMA was preparing internment camps. Discussions of the movement frequently highlighted such theories, often arguing that they proved the Right had “gone” (p. 317).</p>
<p>“That said, the most notable right-wing conspiracy theory of the period was not particularly libertarian. I refer to the idea that Barack Obama and his allies are covering up the true circumstances of the president’s birth. The exact details of the story vary from theorist to theorist, but the usual payoff is that Obama was born in Kenya, not Hawaii, and therefore is ineligible for the presidency.” (pp. 317-318).</p>
<p>“[Barack Obama] spent a chunk of his childhood in Indonesia. His father came from Kenya. When young Obama did live in the United States, he was in Hawaii, the one American state that isn’t actually a part of the Americas. If you don’t conceive of the United States as a multicultural nation, the president’s life is reason enough to consider the man metaphorically foreign. And if there’s one thing conspiracy theories are good at, it’s transmuting the metaphorical into the real.” (p. 319).</p>
<p>“Birtherism wasn’t just paranoid in itself. It fed the paranoid narrative about”rising right-wing violence," as when Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center told NPR that birther-style theories might presage another Oklahoma City bombing." (p. 320).</p>
<p>“The airwaves and Internet were quickly clogged with claims that Loughner had been incited by talk radio, by violent political imagery, by right-wing conspiracy theories,” (p. 320).</p>
<p>“Nearly everything in the previous paragraph is untrue. There never was a boy band called Boy* d Upp, there never was a pop star named Jamie Kane, he never faced a scandal, he never died, and no one ever mourned him. The BBC did report his death, though, and an outline of his alleged career did surface briefly in Wikipedia. And when people realized that those fictions were appearing in venues theoretically devoted to fact, the whiff of foul play did waft through the air.” (p. 325).</p>
<p>“And people have found that symbolism everywhere, from music videos to superhero movies: a massive clue hunt across the entire pop-culture landscape.” (p. 329).</p>
<p>“By the time Prodigy accused Jay-Z of being a member of the Illuminati, Adam Weishaupt’s organization had become the stuff of celebrity gossip; tattoos, hand gestures, and video imagery all became fodder for fans determined to figure out which performers were initiates of the order. You can get the flavor of the fears from an exchange the rapper 50 Cent had on a Philadelphia radio station in 2009.” (pp. 329-330).</p>
<p>“There had never been a game. The man behind the site”just thought it would be funny to put up some creepy notes and see what sort of attention they got," the MetaFilter writer explained. When people decided it was an ARG, “he decided to play along. The numerical ‘codes’ he sent out? Random numbers and dates plucked out of the air.” He provided the noise; the players perceived the pattern. They imagined a labyrinth as elaborate as bin Laden’s legendary fortress in Tora Bora. They found an empty cave." (p. 332).</p>
<p>“The conspiracy theorist will always be with us, because he will always be us. We will never stop finding patterns. We will never stop spinning stories. We will always be capable of jumping to conclusions,” (p. 338).</p>
