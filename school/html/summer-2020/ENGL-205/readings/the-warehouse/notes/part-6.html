<h1 id="part-6-software-update">Part 6: Software Update</h1>
<h2 id="gibson-wells">Gibson Wells</h2>
<ul>
<li>Talks about how he and Ray is like a brother to each other in his blog, how Ray helped him get his first date with his wife Molly, the fake news about in each others throats about Ray not being his successor, and how Ray is cool that Wells daughter will succeed him instead of Ray.</li>
<li>Blogged about playing his daughter’s introduction video to the whole company during the software update, and how proud he is to take on a leadership role in as big as the Cloud.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="zinnia">Zinnia</h2>
<ul>
<li>The gopher’s work was completed and pulled it out from her laptop. Now, all she has to do is find a computer terminal and plug the gopher in.</li>
<li>She had a theory that the more you spend time with someone, the algorithm responsible for their work shifts tend to drove them apart, which somehow explains how things are in the cloud, how people brushed up on each other without engaging.</li>
<li>While preparing for the software update, on her way to the bathroom to take a shower she saw Rick got out of the gender-neutral bathroom followed by Hadley, the girl nice girl with cartoon eyes she met on her first day, her face wet but not by water.</li>
<li>After the Rick encounter, she went to shower in the ladies room where she saw Cynthia and told her that she might go to the hospital for stomach ache. Cynthia advised against because it might affect her employee rating.</li>
<li>Then, Zinnia thought of something else. To fake an injury during her shift by deliberately dislocating her shoulder that was loose ever since that job in Guadalajara, on the off-chance she get to the hospital to continue her mission while the software update is going down.</li>
<li>As she found herself a bed in the hospital, she sneaked into one of the working computers and inserted the gopher to start exploiting some information when Rick hit her head with something from the back. They fought and struggled, then Paxton came to her rescue and restrain Rick while hurriedly pulled the gopher from the computer hoping it had enough time to exploit.</li>
<li>After the incident and got back to her apartment with Paxton, she reached for her laptop while Paxton is getting her some vodka and ice cream and quickly inserted the chip she hid in her mouth during the heat of the moment. She found a store at the northwest side of Live-play with a garbage-shoot maybe, the only way to get her to the water, waste, and energy processing facilities at the southeast corner of the campus.</li>
<li>After waking up in her apartment, her employer sent her a coded message that translates into someone wanting to meet with her off-campus.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="paxton">Paxton</h2>
<ul>
<li>Upset about Vikram being the person in charge next to Dakota after Dobbs handed it to her for a while. He was jealous of Vikram</li>
<li>Told Zinnia about the software update lockdown. Doors will be unlocked and no one should be outside by 8 am but the security and hospital staffs.</li>
<li>While doing his job being a section leader, Vikram accidentally sent a mass message about a hot chick being set to the hospital in an ambulance and some crude comments. Also accessed her employee profile and sent to everyone which Paxton got worried sick quick and went after her.</li>
<li>At the nick of time, before Rick was about to hit Zinnia with the stool, he jumped at him and threw him on the ground. When Rick was finally restrained, he saw Zinnia fiddling with the computer monitor.</li>
<li>Dobbs talk to him to tell Zinnia to leave everything regarding Rick to him and trust that justice will come his way and drop any ideas of escalating it to the official channels.</li>
<li>Paxton can’t dismiss the fact he saw Zinnia fiddling with the computer and Rick accusing her with doing something with the computer as well. “The look on her face, like he’d interrupted her. The dot. the CloudPoint door.” (222).</li>
