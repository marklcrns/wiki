# ECON 121 - Chapter 1 Notes

**Economics**

  - The science of choice, exploring the choices made by individuals and
    organizations.
  - The study of choice when there is scarcity.
    * Economics provides a framework to diagnose all sorts of problems faced by
      society and then helps create and evaluate various proposals to solve
      them.

## 1.1 What is Economics?

**Scarcity**

  - The resources we use to produce goods and services are limited.

**Economics**

  - The study of choices when there is scarcity.

**Factors of production**

  - The resources used to produce goods and services
  - **Five** factors of production
    * **Natural resources**
      - Resources provided by nature and used to produce goods and services.
      - e.g. fertile land, mineral deposits, oil and gas, water
    * **Labor**
      - Human effort, including both physical and mental effort, used to
        produce goods and services.
    * **Physical capital**
      - The stock of equipment, machines, structures, and infrastructure that is
        used to produce goods and services.
    * **Human capital**
      - The knowledge and skills acquired by a worker through education and
        experience and used to produce goods and services.
    * **Entrepreneurship**
      - The effort used to coordinate the factors of production--natural
        resources, labor, physical capital, and human capital--to produce and
        sell products.

> There are trade-offs in everything we do.<br>
> What unites all our decisions is the notion of **Scarcity**: We can't have it
> all.<br>

### 1.1.2 Positive versus Normative Analysis

> Economics doesn't tell us what to choose, but simply helps us to understand
trade-offs.

**Positive Analysis**

  - Most of modern economics is based on positive analysis.
  - Answers the question "What is?" or "What will be?"

**Normative Analysis**

  - Answers the question "What ought to be?"


| Positive Analysis                                                                    | Normative Analysis                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| If the government increases the minimum wage, how many workers will lose their jobs? | Should the government increase the minimum wage?                   |
| If two office-supply firms merge, will the price of office supplies increase?        | Should the government block the merger of two office-supply firms? |
| How does a college education affect a person's productivity and earnings? | Should the government subsidize a college education?
| How do consumers respond to a cut in income taxes? | Should the government cut taxes to stimulate the economy?
| If a nation restricts shoe imports, who benefits and who bears the cost? | Should the government restrict imports?

#### The Three Key Economic Questions: What, How, and Who?

1. **What products do we produce?**
    - Trade-offs exist: If a hospital uses its resources to perform more heart
      transplants, it has fewer resources to care for premature infants.
2. **How do we produce the products?**
    - Alternative means of production are available: Power companies can produce
      electricity with coal, natural gas, or wind power. Professors can teach in
      large lecture halls or small classrooms.
3. **Who consumes the products?**
    - We must decide how to distribute the products of society. If some people
      earn more money than others, should they consume more goods? How much
      money should the government take from the rich and give to the poor?

### 1.1.3 Economic Models

**Economic Model**

  - A simplified representation of an economic environment, often employing a
    graph.

> Economists use _economic models_ to explore the choices people make and the
consequences of those choices.

## 1.2 Economic Analysis and Modern Problems

### 1.2.1 Economic View of Traffic Congestion

<pre>
Consider first the problem of traffic congestion. According to the Texas
Transportation Institute, the typical U.S. commuter wastes about 42 hours per
year because of traffic congestion.1 In some cities, the time wasted is much
greater: 82 hours in Washington, D.C., 80 hours in Los Angeles, 78 hours in San
Francisco, and 74 hours in New York. In addition to time lost, we also waste 3
billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel each year.

To an economist, the diagnosis of the congestion problem is straightforward.
When you drive onto a busy highway during rush hour, your car takes up space and
decreases the distance between the vehicles on the highway. A driver's normal
reaction to a shorter distance between moving cars is to slow down. So, when you
enter the highway, you force other commuters to slow down and thus spend more
time on the highway. If each of your 900 fellow commuters spends just two extra
seconds on the highway, you will increase the total travel time by 30 minutes.
In deciding whether to use the highway, you will presumably ignore these costs
you impose on others. Similarly, your fellow commuters ignore the cost they
impose on you and others when they enter the highway. Because no single commuter
pays the full cost (30 minutes), too many people use the highway, and everyone
wastes time.

One possible solution to the congestion problem is to force people to pay for
using the road, just as they pay for gasoline and tires. The government could
impose a congestion tax of $8 per trip on rush-hour commuters and use a debit
card system to collect the tax: Every time a car passes a checkpoint, a
transponder would charge the commuter's card. Traffic volume during rush hours
would then decrease as travelers (a) shift their travel to off-peak times, (b)
switch to ride-sharing and mass transit, and (c) shift their travel to less
congested routes. The job for the economist is to compute the appropriate
congestion tax and predict the consequences of imposing it.
</pre>

### 1.2.2 Trade-offs from International Trade

<pre>
Most nations are not self-sufficient, but instead specialize in producing
some products and import other products from their trading partners. For
example, Canada's climate is suitable for growing fir trees and producing
plywood panels, while Mexico's climate is suitable for growing lemon trees
and producing lemons.  If Canada specializes in plywood panels and Mexico
specializes in lemons, there are more panels and lemons available to
consume, and each country can consume more of both products.

There are trade-offs associated with changes in trade patterns. Suppose
Canada initially grows all the lemons it consumes in heated greenhouses,
while Mexico initially grows fir trees in air-conditioned greenhouses. The
policy makers recognize the inherent inefficiency of using greenhouses
rather than outdoor growing, and promote trade in lemons from Mexico and
plywood panels from Canada.  As we'll see later in the book, there are
trade-offs associated with specialization and trade.

1. Lower prices for lemons and plywood panels: It is less costly to grow
  lemons and trees outdoors, so the price of lemons in Canada will
  decrease, and so will the price of plywood panels in Mexico.

2. Canada jobs: Wood employment increases, while lemon employment decreases.

3. Mexico jobs: Lemon employment increases, while plywood panel employment
  decreases.

4. Greenhouse jobs: In both countries, there will be fewer jobs in
  greenhouse fabrication.

To illustrate the trade-offs from an increase in trade, let's take the
Canadian perspective. Consumers are winners, as they pay a lower price for
lemons. Wood workers are winners, too, as the demand for their services
increases, boosting their wages. In contrast, workers who initially grew
lemons or built greenhouses are losers in the short run: the demand for
their services decreases, resulting in job losses or lower wages. Of course,
trade increases the number of wood jobs in Canada, and if lemon and
greenhouse workers could be instantly converted into wood workers, the
negative employment consequences would be short lived. But workers are not
interchangeable parts that can be instantly reallocated to wood production,
so the adjustment to the new labor environment takes time. As a result,
workers who are displaced by lemon imports will experience low wages and
fewer job opportunities, and the negative consequences will persist until
they make the transition into new jobs in the wood industry.

As we'll see later in the book, the adjustment costs associated with changes
in trade patterns present challenges for policy makers. In the United
States, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program (TAA) assists displaced
workers in their search for new jobs. The TAA provides job training,
relocation allowances, job information, and other assistance. The deployment
of TAA can reduce the negative employment effects of an increase in
international trade.

### 1.2.3 Economic View of Managing the U.S. Economy

<pre>
The United States and the rest of the world have now recovered from the
financial crisis that gripped the world in 2007. If all goes well, the world
economy will resume a normal rate of economic growth and living standards
will rise throughout the world. Economists and policy makers shifted their
focus to the potential overheating of economies and the possibility of
inflation (rising prices).

In combating the <b>global recession triggered by the financial crisis of
2007</b> governments throughout the world <b>made it much easier for firms and
households to borrow money for investment and consumer goods. Governments
used clever financial policies to drop interest rates to historic lows,</b>
and firms and households responded by increasing their spending. <b>Now that
economies throughout the world have recovered, economists and policy makers
are concerned that firms and households may borrow and spend too much,
resulting in overheated economies and rising prices.</b>

In the United States, new tax and spending policies adopted in 2018 pose the
same risk of overheating and inflation. The U.S. government cut taxes on
businesses to encourage investment spending and relaxed spending
constraints. In combination, these tax and spending policies have the
potential to increase the demand for goods and services by an amount
sufficient to overheat the economy.  Over the next few years, <b>the
objective of policy makers is to adjust taxes, spending, and financial
policies to keep the economy growing without causing inflation.</b>

## 1.3 The Economic Way of Thinking

> **There are 4 Elements of the economic way of thinking...**

### 1.3.1 Use Assumptions to Simplify

* Simplifying analysis may result to an unrealistic assumptions.
* Although some analyses are based on unrealistic assumptions, that doesn't mean
  that your analyses are invalid/faulty.
* The lesson is that we must think carefully about whether a simplifying
  assumption is truly harmless.

### 1.3.2 Isolate Variables--_Ceteris Paribus_

> _Ceteris paribus_ is a latin expression meaning that other variables are held
fix

* Economic analysis often involves variables and how they affect one another.
  - A _variable_ is a measure of something that can take on different
    values.
* Economists are interested in exploring relationships between two variables.
* They isolate a variable apart from others that are effectively changing the
  value of the outcome to see the relationship between the variable from each
  other.

### 1.3.3 Think at the Margin

**Marginal change**

  - A small, one-unit change in value.
  - For example, you might ask, “If I study just one more hour, by how much will
    my exam score increase?” Economists call this process “thinking at the
    margin.” Thinking at the margin is like thinking on the edge.

### 1.3.4 Rational People Respond to Incentives

  - A key assumption of most economic analysis is that people act rationally,
    meaning they act in their own self-interest.
  - Rational people respond to incentives. When the payoff, or benefit, from
    doing something changes, people change their behavior to get the benefit.

### 1.3.5 Example: Southern California Addresses Its Congestion Problem

To illustrate the economic way of thinking, let's consider again how an
economist would approach the problem of traffic congestion. Recall that each
driver on the highway slows down other drivers but ignores these time costs when
deciding whether to use the highway. If the government imposes a congestion tax
to reduce traffic during rush hour, the economist is faced with a question: How
high should the tax be?

To determine the appropriate congestion tax, an economist would assume that
people respond to incentives and use the three other elements of the economic
way of thinking:

* **Use assumptions to simplify.** To simplify the problem, we would assume that
  every car has the same effect on the travel time of other cars. Of course,
  this is unrealistic because people drive cars of different sizes in different
  ways. But the alternative--looking at the effects of each car on travel
  speeds--would needlessly complicate the analysis.

* **Isolate variables--use _ceteris paribus_.** To focus attention on the
  effects of a congestion tax on the number of cars using the highway, we would
  make the _ceteris paribus_ assumption that everything else that affects travel
  behavior--the price of gasoline, bus fares, and consumer income--remains
  fixed.

* **Think at the margin.** To think at the margin, we would estimate the effects
  of adding one more car to the highway. Now consider the marginal question: If
  we add one more car to the highway, by how much does the total travel time for
  commuters increase? Once we answer this question, we can determine the cost
  imposed by the marginal driver. If the marginal driver forces each of the 900
  commuters to spend two extra seconds on the highway, total travel time
  increases by 30 minutes. If the value of time is, say, $16 per hour, the
  appropriate congestion tax would be $8 (equal to $16 x 1/2 hour).

## 1.4 Employability: Economic Logic on the Job

* Training in economics develops decision-making skills, so it is useful for any
  job that requires critical thinking and problem solving.

Examples:

  1. A production manager can use economic reasoning to decide what products to
     produce and how much of each product to produce.
  2. A salesperson can use economic logic to decide how to allocate his or her
     time to potential customers.
  3. A sales manager can use economics to choose a price for a product.
  4. A marketing manager can use economic reasoning to allocate a marketing
     budget across different markets.
  5. A corporate strategist can use economic logic to predict a competitor's
     response to a price cut.
  6. A personnel manager can use economic reasoning to choose a compensation
     package (i.e., wages, fringe benefits, stock options) for employees.
  7. A store manager can use economic logic to decide whether to keep a shop
     open during bad weather, or to close early.
  8. A teacher can use economics to decide how to allocate time between
     lecturing, small-group discussion, and individual instruction.
  9. An accountant with production data can use economic logic to determine
     whether an increase in output will increase the firm's profit.
  10. A supporter of fair-trade practices in chocolate can use economics to
      determine how well a seller is performing in terms of paying cacao farmers
      and promoting environmental health.
  11. An environmental regulator can use economic reasoning to choose the most
      efficient environmental policy.
  12. A city manager can use economic logic to predict tax revenue and public
      spending.
  13. A financial planner designs an investment portfolio for a client.
  14. A CFO (chief financial officer) decides how to raise money for a new
      factory.
  15. The manager of a software startup decides when to “go public” by selling
      shares of stock.

## 1.5 Preview of Coming Attractions: Macroeconomics

**Macroeconomics**

  - The study of the nation's economy as a whole; focuses on the issues of
    inflation (a general rise in prices), unemployment, and economic growth.

### Three ways we can use Macroeconomics

1. **Using Macroeconomics to Understand Why Economies Grow.**

  - Macroeconomics explains why resources increase over time and the
    consequences for our standard of living.
  - e.g., In the fastest growing countries, citizens save a large fraction of
    the money they earn, and have well-educated workforces, allowing firms to
    quickly adopt new technologies that increase worker productivity.

2. **Using Macroeconomics to Understand Economic Fluctuations**

  - Macroeconomics helps us understand the economy sometimes cools and sometimes
    overheats.

3. **Using Macroeconomics to Make Informed Business Decisions**

  - The government uses various policies to influence interest rates (the price
    of borrowing money) and the inflation rate.
  -  A manager who studies macroeconomics will be better equipped to understand
     the complexities of interest rates and inflation and how they affect the
     firm.

## 1.6 Preview of Coming Attractions: Microeconomics

**Microeconomics**

  - The study of the choices made by households, firm, and government and how
    these choices affect the market for goods and services.

### Three ways we can use Microeconomics analysis

1. **Using Microeconomics to Understand Markets and Predict Changes**

  - One reason for studying microeconomics is to better understand how markets
    work and to predict how various events affect the prices and quantities of
    products in markets.
  - e.g., A tax on beer would make the product more expensive, and young adults,
    like other beer drinkers, would therefore consume less of it. Consequently,
    a tax that decreases beer consumption by roughly 10 percent will decrease
    highway deaths among young adults by roughly 10 percent, too.

2. **Using Microeconomics to Make Personal and Managerial Decisions**

  - On the personal level, we use economic analysis to decide how to spend our
    time, what career to pursue, and how to spend and save the money we earn.
    Managers use economic analysis to decide how to produce goods and services,
    how much to produce, and how much to charge for them.
  - e.g., If the existing coffee shops in your city are profitable and you have
    enough money to start your own shop, should you do it? If you enter this
    market, the competition among the shops for consumers will heat up, causing
    some coffee shops to drop their prices. In addition, your costs may be
    higher than the costs of the stores that are already established. It would
    be sensible to enter the market only if you expect a small drop in price and
    a small difference in costs.

3. **Using Microeconomics to Evaluate Public Policies**

  - Like other innovations, prescription drugs are protected by government
    patents, giving the developer the exclusive right to sell a new drug for a
    fixed period of time. Once the patent expires, other pharmaceutical
    companies can legally produce and sell generic versions of the drug, which
    causes its price to drop. Should drug patents be shorter? Shortening the
    patent has trade-offs. The good news is that generic versions of the drug
    will be available sooner, so prices will drop sooner and more people will
    use the drug to improve their health. The bad news is that the financial
    payoff from developing new drugs will be smaller, so pharmaceutical
    companies won't develop as many new drugs. The question is whether the
    benefit of shorter patents (lower prices) exceeds the cost (fewer drugs
    developed).

## 1A.1 Using Graphs

### Graph of Single Variables

  * **Pie Graph**
    - Useful for visualizing and compare the share of something among its
      competitors, industry, sector, or peers.
  * **Bar Graph**
    - Very useful for making quick comparisons across different sections

Time Series Graphs

  * **Normal Time-Series Graph**
    - Shows the change of a variable overtime at each points.

  * **Truncated Vertical Axis Time-Series Graph**
    - Shows a truncated vertical axis (y-axis) to accentuate the fluctuations of
      the time-series line of a variable.

### Graphing Two variables

  * **Positive Relationship**
    - A relationship in which two variables move in the same direction.
  * **Negative Relationship**
    - A relationship in which two variables move in opposite directions.
    - When a variable increase the other variable decreases, and vice versa.

### Computing the Slope

             Vertical difference between two points (y-axis)    rise
    Slope = ------------------------------------------------- = ----
            Horizontal difference between two points (x-axis)   run

             y² - y¹
    Slope = ---------
             x² - x¹

             △y
    Slope = ----
             △x


## 1A.2 Computing Percentage Changes and Using Equations

### Computing Percentage Changes

                          New value - initial value
    Percentage change =  --------------------------- × 100
                                Initial value

Example 1: Increase

                         22 - 20          2
    Percentage change =  -------- × 100 = -- × 100 = 10%
                            20            20

Example 2: Decrease

                         19 - 20            1
    Percentage change =  -------- × 100 = - -- × 100 = -5%
                            20              20

Alternative. Basing the percentage change on the average value, or the midpoint,
of the variable:

                          New value - initial value
    Percentage change =  --------------------------- × 100
                                Average value

Example:

                            22 - 20              2            2
    Percentage change =  ------------- × 100 = ------ × 100 = -- × 100
                         (20 + 22) / 2         42 / 2         21

                      = 9.52%

#### The Perils of Percentages

In the 1970s the government of Mexico City repainted the highway lane lines on
the Viaducto to transform a four-lane highway into a six-lane highway. The
government announced that the highway capacity had increased by 50 percent
(equal to 2 divided by 4). Unfortunately, the number of collisions and traffic
fatalities increased, and one year later, the government restored the four-lane
highway and announced that the capacity had decreased by 33 percent (equal to 2
divided by 6). The government announced that the net effect of the two changes
was an increase in the highway capacity by 17 percent (equal to 50 percent minus
33 percent).

This anecdote reveals a potential problem with using the simple approach to
compute percentage changes. Because the initial value (the denominator) changes,
the computation of percentage increases and decreases are not symmetric. In
contrast, if the government had used the midpoint method, the percentage
increase in capacity would be 40 percent (equal to 2 divided by 5), the same as
the percentage decrease. In that case, we get the more sensible result that the
net effect of the two changes is zero.
