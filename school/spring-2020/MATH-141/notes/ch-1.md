### Sets of Numbers

  - The sets of numbers used in algebra are, in general, subsets of **_R_**, the
    set of **real numbers**.
    * **Natural numbers**
      - **_N_**: The counting numbers.
      - e.g., 1, 2, 3.
      - **NOTE:** Zero (0) is not a natural number.
    * **Integers**
      - **_Z_**: The counting numbers, together with their opposites and 0.
      - e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, -1, −2, −3
    * **Rational Numbers**
      - **_Q:_** The set of all numbers that can be written as quotients a/b, b
        ≠ 0, a and b integers
      - e.g., 3/17, −5/13
    * **Irrational Numbers**
      - **_H:_** All real numbers that are not rational numbers
      - e.g., π, 2 , 5 , −π/3

**Examples**

  - The number −5 is a member of the sets **_Z_**, **_Q_**, **_R_**.
  - The number 156.73 is a member of the sets **_Q_**, **_R_**.
  - The number 5π is a member of the sets **_H_**, **_R_**.

### Axioms

There are two fundamental operations, addition and multiplication, which
have the following properties (a, b, c arbitrary real numbers):

  * Commutative Laws :
    - a + b = b + a: order does not matter in addition.
    - ab = ba: order does not matter in multiplication.
  * Associative Laws:
    - a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c: grouping does not matter in repeated addition.
    - a(bc) = (ab)c: grouping does not matter in repeated multiplication.
  * Distributive Laws:
    - a(b + c) = ab + ac; also (a + b)c = ac + bc: multiplication is
      distributive over addition.

  * Zero Factor Laws:
    - For every real number a, a ⋅ 0 = 0.
    - If ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0.
  * Laws for Negatives:
    - − (− a) = a
    - (− a)(− b) = ab
    - − ab = (− a)b = a(− b) = − (− a)(− b) = − (ab)
    - (− 1)a = − a
  * Laws for Quotients:
    - \- a/b = -a/b = a/-b = \- -a/-b
    - -a/-b = a/b
    - a/b = c/d if and only if ad = bc.

## 1.3 Solving: Polynomial Degree 1

### Solving Linear Equations Intro

[Video Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/embed/dDJT81TrCCw)

Linear equations contains equations that has one variable with a degree of 1

Samples of Linear Equations:

  * 3x = 11 _or_ 3x¹ = 11
  * 3x + 4x = 125 _or_ 3x¹ + 4x¹ = 125

### 4 Steps in Solving Linear Equations

#### Step 4: Kill the coefficient

  * [Video Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/embed/BSIXtFkNvzk)

**Example 1:**

Consider 3x = 125

This can be done by getting rid of the coefficient of x (3) by multiplying 1/3 on
both sides--_cancellation of multiplication_

Solution:

    3x = 125
    1/3(3x) = 1/3(125)

    x = 125/3

**Example 2:**

Consider 5x = 30 + π

Solution:

    5x = 30 + π

    x = (30 + π)/5

#### Step 3: Collect x's

  * [Video Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/embed/e6w0VbPYXKg)

**Example 1:**

Consider 3x + 4x = 125

Solution:

    3x + 4x = 125
    (3 + 4)x = 125     Distribute the x

    x =  125           Kill the coefficient
        -----
        3 + 4

**Example 2:**

Consider 7x + 5x = 125 + √8

Solution:

    7x + 5x = 125 + √8
    (7 + 5)x = 125 + √8

    x = 125 + √8
        --------
         7 + 5

**Example 3:**

Consider 5x + πx = 30 + 2/5

Solution:

    5x + πx = 30 + 2/5
    (5x + π)x = 30 + 2/5

    x = 30 + 2/5
        --------
         5 + π

**Example 4:**

Consider 5x + √7x = 30 + π

Solution:

    5x + √7x = 30 + π
    (5x + √7)x = 30 + π

    x = 30 + π
        ------
        5 + √7

**Example 5:**

Consider

          √3x   4
    5πx + --- = - + π
           9    7

Solution:

          √3x   4
    5πx + --- = - + π
           9    7
    (5π + √3/9)x = 4/7 + π

    x =  4/7 + π
        ---------
        5π + √3/9

#### Step 2: Move x's

  * [Video Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/embed/001YOoma3B0)

We CAN'T gather the x's if they are NOT all on one side

**Example 1:**

Consider 3x - 4 = 12x + 11

Solution:

    3x - 4 = 12x + 11
    3x + -4 = 12x + 11            (Optional) Convert subtraction to addition to
                                  makes it easier
    3x + -4 + 4 = 12x + 11 + 4    Kill the coefficient by adding 4 to both sides
    3x = 12x + 15
    3x + -12x = 12x + 15 - 12x    Move the 12x by subtracting it to both sides.
                                  Cancellation law of addition
    3x + -12x = 15
    (3 + -12)x = 15               Distributive law

    x =   15
        -------
        3 - 12

**Example 2:**

Consider 3x - 1/2 = 13 - 11x

Solution 1:

    3x - 1/2 = 13 - 11x
    3x + -1/2 + 1/2 = 13 - 11x + 1/2    Subtraction to addition for convenience.
                                        Then, add 1/2 to both sides to kill it
    3x = 13 + -11x + 1/2
    3x + 11x = 13 + -11x + 1/2 = 11x    Move 11x to the other side by
                                        cancellation law of addition
    3x + 11x = 13 + 1/2
    (3 + 11)x = 13 + 1/2                Distributive law

    x = 13 + 1/2                        Kill the coefficient and done
        --------
         3 + 11

Solution 2:

    3x - 1/2 = 13 - 11x
    2(3x + -1/2) = (13 - 11x)2    Subtraction to addition for convenience. Then,
                                  multiply both sides by 2 to kill to get rid of
                                  the fraction
    6x + -1 = 26 + -22x

    6x + 22x = 26 + 1             For shortcuts, just move the numbers on either
                                  sides by just changing the signs
    (6 + 22)x = 27                Distributive law

    x =   27                      Kill the coefficient and done
        ------
        6 + 22

**Example 3:**

Consider 3/5x - 1/2 = 3/10 + 7x

Solution:

    3/5x - 1/2 = 3/10 + 7x
    3/5x + -1/2 + 1/2 = 3/10 + 7x + 1/2    Get rid of 1/2 by adding to both
                                           sides
    3/5x = 3/10 + 7x + 1/2
    3/5x + -7x = 3/10 + 7x + 1/2 + -7x     Move 7x by cancellation law of
                                           addition
    3/5x + -7x  = 3/10 + 1/2
    (3/5 + -7)x = 3/10 + 1/2               Gather the x's

    x = 3/10 + 1/2
        ----------
         3/5 - 7

#### Step 1: Free x's

* [Video Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/embed/sA9W32Wx5Hw)

We CAN'T MOVE the x's if they are trapped inside ()'s or fractions

**Example 1:**

Consider 3(x + 1) = 2(x - 5)

Solution:

    Step 1:
    3(x + 1) = 2(x - 5)
    3x + 3 = 2x + -10       Distributive property. Free the x's out of ()'s

    Step 2
    3x + -2x = -10 + -3     Move 2x to the other side to gather all x's

    Step 3
    (3 + -2)x = -10 + -3    Gather the x's

    Step 4
    x = -10 - 3            Kill the coefficient
        --------
         3 - 2

**Example 2:**

Consider

              x + 4        11x + 1
    3(x +1) - ----- = 13 - -------
                2             3

Solution:

              x + 4        11x + 1
    3(x +1) - ----- = 13 - -------
                2             3
    3x + 3 + -(x/2 + 4/2) = 13 + -(11x/3 + 1/3)    Convert to addition and apply
                                                   distributive property
    3x + 3 + -x/2 + -4/2 = 1 + -11/3x + -1/3
    3x + -x/2 + 11/3x = 13 + -1/3 - 3 + 4/2        Move all variables to one
                                                   side and coefficients to the
                                                   other
    (3 - 1/2 + 11/3)x = 13 + -1/3 -3 + 4/2         Gather the x's

    x = 13 - 1/3 - 3 + 4/2
        ------------------
          3 - 1/2 + 11/3
