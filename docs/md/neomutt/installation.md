# Installation

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install neomutt -y
```

Then create Mutt directories:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.mutt/cache/headers mkdir ~/.mutt/cache/bodies touch ~/.mutt/certificates
```

Finally, add these to your `.muttrc`

```muttrc
set header_cache = "~/.mutt/cache/headers"
set message_cachedir = "~/.mutt/cache/bodies"
set certificate_file = "~/.mutt/certificates"
```

**NOTE:** Mutt configuration resides in `~/.muttrc` or `~/.mutt/.muttrc`
