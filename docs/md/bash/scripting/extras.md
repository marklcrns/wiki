## Prevent Bash Script From Being Executed

Method 1: Remove file executable property with `chmod`

```sh
chmod -x /path/to/script
```

Method 2: With actual script

```sh
if [ ${0##*/} == ${BASH_SOURCE[0]##*/} ]; then
  echo "WARNING"
  echo "This script is not meant to be executed directly!"
  echo "Use this script only by sourcing it."
  echo
  exit 1
fi
```
