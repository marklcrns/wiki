## Prevent Bash Script From Being Executed

Method 1: Remove file executable property with `chmod`

```sh
chmod -x /path/to/script
```

Method 2: With actual script

```sh
if [ ${0##*/} == ${BASH_SOURCE[0]##*/} ]; then
  echo "WARNING"
  echo "This script is not meant to be executed directly!"
  echo "Use this script only by sourcing it."
  echo
  exit 1
fi
```

## Get Script Paths and Name

```sh
# Script absolute path
SCRIPTPATH="$(realpath -s $0)"
# Script name
SCRIPTNAME="$(basename ${0})"
# Script directory
SCRIPTDIR="$( cd "$( dirname "$0" )" && pwd )"
SCRIPTDIR="$(dirname ${SCRIPTPATH})"
```

Better solution. Also resolves when script is symlink.

```sh
SCRIPTPATH="${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"
while [ -h "$SCRIPTPATH" ]; do # resolve $SOURCE until the file is no longer a symlink
  SCRIPTDIR="$( cd -P "$( dirname "$SCRIPTPATH" )" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )"
  SCRIPTPATH="$(readlink "$SCRIPTPATH")"
  [[ $SCRIPTPATH != /* ]] && SCRIPTPATH="$SCRIPTDIR/$SCRIPTPATH" # if $SOURCE was a relative symlink, we need to resolve it relative to the path where the symlink file was located
done

SCRIPTDIR="$( cd -P "$( dirname "$SCRIPTPATH" )" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )"
```
