# Loops

## Looping Over Lines in a Variable String

```sh
list="One\ntwo\nthree\nfour"

while IFS= read -r line; do
  echo "$line"
done <<< "$list"

# or

echo "$list" | while IFS= read -r line; do
  echo "$line"
done

# or

for line in $(echo ${list}); do
  echo "$line"
done
```

For variables with literal string

```sh
echo -e "$list" | while IFS= read -r line; do
  echo "$line"
done
```

## Looping Over Filtered File Path Returned by Find

Method 1:

```sh
find . -name '*.txt' - print0 |
  while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do
    # do something with "$file"
  done
```

> **NOTE:** _Each command of a pipeline is executed in a separate subshell_. So
variables outside of the loop that are modified inside of the subshell will not
change the value of the variables outside.

Method 2: (Recommended)

```sh
while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do
  # do something with "$file"
done < <(find . -name '*.txt' - print0)
```

> This method allows for variable modification outside of the loop. See _process
substitution_.
